1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,753
Your argument is lacking
in all scientific merit.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,505
And it is well-established...

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:10,009
...Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth's yellow sun...

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,261
...which incinerates
any contaminant matter...

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,765
...and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,060
What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,148
- Like what?
- I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,401
I think we can assume all Kryptonian
condiments were destroyed...

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,154
...when the planet Krypton exploded.

10
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,281
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,618
The only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hot dog threatening Earth.

12
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,122
Raj, please, let's stay serious here.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,834
Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,503
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

15
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,756
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

16
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,633
Okay. He's invited for dinner
in the bottle city of Kandor.

17
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,220
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city,
where he loses his super-powers.

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,474
Before dinner, his host says,
"Who's up for Kryptonian tetherball?"

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,852
Superman works up a sweat, comes back
to Earth, his uniform now stained...

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,605
...with indestructible
Kryptonian perspiration.

21
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,318
Booyah.

22
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,448
Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry-cleaner...

23
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,742
...before he left the bottle.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,663
Kandorian dry-cl...? I give up. You can't have
a rational argument with this man.

25
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,543
Hey, isn't that the guy who won
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

26
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,505
No, not all at once.

27
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,800
- Then how?
- Leonard.

28
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,969
Now Raj.

29
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,389
Now Sheldon.

30
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,894
- I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?
- No.

31
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,064
- That's David Underhill. So what?
- So what?

32
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,776
His observation of high-energy positrons
has provided the first evidence...

33
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,028
...for the existence
of galactic dark matter.

34
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,615
I have two words for you.
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

35
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,994
It is a big whoop. Made almost all the work
you've done completely useless.

36
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,038
- Did not.
- Did too.

37
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,582
Okay, maybe some of it. But...

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,085
The guy was just in the right place
at the right time...

39
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,963
...with the right paradigm-shifting
reinterpretation of the universe.

40
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,006
He got lucky.

41
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,591
In more ways than one.

42
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,511
He's a very handsome man.

43
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,430
Doesn't do anything for me.
If I was gonna go that way...

44
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,600
...I'm more of a Zac Efron kind of guy.

45
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,980
Oh, yeah.
Like you have a shot with Zac Efron.

46
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,109
Excuse me. Are you Leonard Hofstadter?

47
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,611
- Uh, yeah.
- I'm David Underhill.

48
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,948
Uh, yeah. Heh, heh.

49
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,326
Dr. Gablehauser said
if I wanted to set up something in the lab...

50
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,453
...that you'd be able to give me a hand?

51
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,039
- You wanna work with me?
- If you have time, yeah.

52
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,502
Wow. Yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem.

53
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,965
Um, here's my home number,
here's my cell, here's my office...

54
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,135
...here's my parents' number
up in New Jersey.

55
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,845
- They know how to reach me.
<font color="#808080">DAVID</font>: Okay.

56
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,015
Congratulations on the MacArthur grant,
by the way. Big fan.

57
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,142
Thanks. I'll call you.

58
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,768
Okay.

59
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,228
Bye-bye.

60
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,111
What are you looking at?
You've never seen a hypocrite before?

61
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,722
Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike...

62
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,183
...if he has hopes of catching up
with Sheldon...

63
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:51,396
...who is dominating in the ninth frame

Hey, guys.

65
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,243
That doesn't count. Do-over, do-over.

66
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,329
There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.

67
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,667
There are always do-overs
when my people play sports.

68
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,003
Where were you that's more important
than Wii bowling night?

69
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,005
- Actually, I...
- It's a rhetorical question.

70
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,841
There is nothing more important
than Wii bowling night.

71
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,928

and we suck at it.

Nice motivational speech
from the team captain.

74
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,019
- Where were you?
- I was working with Dave Underhill.

75
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,274
Ooh, "Dave."
Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.

76
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,653
Actually, he is pretty cool.
I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist...

77
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,281
...but it turns out
he's a black-diamond skier...

78
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,534
...he collects vintage motorcycles,
he plays in a rock band.

79
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,413
- So? We're in a rock band.
- No.

80
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,874
We play "Rock Band" on our Xbox.

81

Nice motivational speech
from our lead guitarist.

82
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,171
He's funny too.

83
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:03,010
He does this hysterical impersonation
of Stephen Hawking having phone sex.

90
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,574
Hey, Sheldon. Are you and Leonard
putting up a Christmas tree?

91
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,786
No, because we don't celebrate
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

92
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,414
Saturnalia?

93
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:37,627
Gather around, kids. It's time for Sheldon's
beloved Christmas special.

94
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:43,050
In the pre-Christian era, as the winter
solstice approached and the plants died...

95
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:47,095
...pagans brought evergreen boughs in their
homes as an act of sympathetic magic...

96
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,474
...intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.

97
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,101
This custom was appropriated
by northern Europeans...

98
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,271
...and, eventually, it becomes
the so-called Christmas tree.

99
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,985
And that, Charlie Brown,
is what boredom is all about.

100
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,491
Okay, well, thank you for that.
I got you and Leonard silly neighbor gifts...

101
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,494
- ...so I'll just put them under my tree.
- Wait.

102
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,829
- You bought me a present?
- Uh-huh.

103
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,956
Why would you do such a thing?

104
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,460
- I don't know. Because it's Christmas?
- Oh, Penny.

105
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,212
I know you think you're being generous...

106
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,964
...but the foundation of gift-giving
is reciprocity.

107
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,177
You haven't given me a gift,
you've given me an obligation.

108
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,306
Don't feel bad, Penny.
It's a classic rookie mistake.

109
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,643
My first Hanukkah with Sheldon,
he yelled at me for eight nights.

110
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,147
It's okay.
You don't have to get me anything.

111
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,318
Of course I do. The essence of the custom
is that I now have to go and purchase...

112
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,197
...a gift of commensurate value and
representing the same level of friendship...

113
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,367
...as that represented by the gift
you've given me.

114
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,703
It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket
this time of year.

115
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,706
Okay, forget it,
I'm not giving you a present.

116
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,835
No, it's too late. I see it.

The moving finger has writ.

Hannibal has crossed the Alps.

00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,221
I know. It's funny
when it's not happening to us.

120
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,519
- Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
- No, no. I brought this on myself...

and important part of your life.

00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,398
Afterwards, we take the bike up the coast,
we grab a bite to eat?

162
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,443
Um, yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.
Let me just get my jacket.

163
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,822

164
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,074
Boy, she'll do, huh?

165
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,703
Yeah, if you like that type.

166
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,830
So you and her...?

167
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,165
- No, just neighbors.
- Really?

168
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,253
I don't know how you live next door to that
without doing something about it.

169
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,214
Actually...

170
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,883
...science is my lady.

171
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,721
- Okay. Let's go.
- All right.

172
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,056
- See you tomorrow, Leonard.
- See you.

173
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,684
Bye, Penny. Have fun.

174
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,024
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
Yes?

175
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,617
Did you forget your key?

176
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,797
Well, I don't see anything in here
a woman would want.

177
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:38,053
You're kidding.
You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps.

178
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,389
That's the estrogen hat trick.

179
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:48,396
What it is is a cacophonous assault of
eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla.

180
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,983
It's as if my head were trapped
in the pajamas of a sultan.

181
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:57,030
Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff,
let's just go next door and build her a bear.

182
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,992
I told you before, bears are terrifying.

183
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,704
Come on, bath stuff. It's perfect.

184
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,749
You got a scented candle,
a cleansing buff.

185
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,418
Spearmint-and-green-tea-scented bath oil
promotes relaxation.

186
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,087
That presupposes Penny is tense.

187
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,256
She knows you. She's tense.
We all are. Buy a basket.

188
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,259
- Excuse me, we're ready.
- No, we're not.

189
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,013
Let's say for a moment that
I accept the bath-item-gift hypothesis.

190
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:26,267
I now lay the following conundrum
at your feet. Which size?

191
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,478
This one. Let's go.

192
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,773
- You put no thought into that.
- I'm sorry. Ah...

193
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,359
This one. Let's go.

194
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,445
I have insufficient data to proceed.

195
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,031
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

196
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,534
If I were to give you this gift basket...

197
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,036
...based on that action alone
and no other data...

198
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:50,125
...infer and describe the hypothetical
relationship that exists between us.

199
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,961
Excuse me?

200
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,505
Here.

201
00:11:55,756 --> 00:12:00,135
Now are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers?

202
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,220
Are you my grandmother?

203
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,141
I don't understand
what you're talking about...

204
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,935
...and you're making me
a little uncomfortable.

205
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,063
See? Sounds just like you and Penny.
We'll take it.

206
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,862
Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.

207
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,490
Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny.
What a surprise.

208
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,201
Hey, Leonard. Dave was showing me
around the university.

209
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,328
You know, this place is unbelievable.

210
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,957
Yeah, I know. I've been offering
to show you around for a year and a half.

211
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,001
You always said you had yoga.

212
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,588
- I never said that.
- Maybe I heard you wrong.

213
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,174
A lot of words sound like "yoga."

214
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,678
This is an amazing woman, Leonard.
She has a curious and agile mind.

215
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,765
Not to mention being curious and agile
in other respects.

216
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,767
Shut up.

217
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,269
Yes, please, shut up.

218
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:56,357
So, um, Dave, don't you think
you and I should get back to the lab?

219
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,861
You know, that dark matter
isn't gonna detect itself.

220
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,868
I was thinking about taking the afternoon
off so I could experiment with Penny.

221
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,704
- Really? We're gonna do an experiment?
<font color="#808080">DAVID</font>: Uh-huh.

222
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:14,209
We're gonna explore the effects of tequila
shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

223
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,545
That's not an experiment.
You saw what happened last night.

224
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,548
<font color="#808080">DAVID</font>: You ready to go?
- Yeah.

225
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,092
- Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
- Yeah, why not?

226
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,053
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

227
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,931
- Oh, my God.
- No, that's good. That's funny.

228
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,937
By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

229
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,922
Mm. Great news, Leonard.
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

230
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,757
Yippee.

231
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,219
You see, the danger was that
I might under-or over-reciprocate...

232
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,304
...but I have devised a foolproof plan.

233
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:14,185
I will open her gift to me first and then
excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.

234
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,438
Then I'll look up the price
of her gift online...

235
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,192
...choose the basket closest to that value,
give it to her...

236
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,487
...and then I'll return the others
for a full refund.

237
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,448
Brilliant.

238
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,576
It is, isn't it?

239
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,995
Is it okay if I hide them in your room?

240
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:35,164
The smell makes me nauseated.

241
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,877
- Do whatever you want.
- Thank you. That's very gracious.

242
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,672
Gentlemen?

243
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,511
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: Why couldn't you have
just done what Leonard did...

244
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,180
...and get Penny a new boyfriend?

245
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,313
My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.

00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,405
<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

247
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,367
Okay, I have just one question for you.

248
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,995
While I am perfectly happy
with the way things are...

249
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,874
...you said that you didn't wanna go out
with me because I was too smart for you.

250
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:22,211
Well, news flash, lady:
David Underhill is 10 times smarter than me.

251
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,841
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into
his brain for me to beat him at checkers.

252
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:32,513
Next to him, I'm one of those sign-language
gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes.

253
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,850
So my question is...

254
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,144
...what's up with that?

255
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,023
Why are you yelling at me?

256
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,361
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Never mind, we're cool.

257
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,530
Dave is not smarter than you.
He's an idiot.

258
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,034
Really? Why would you say that?

259
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,080
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos
of his wife off his cell phone...

260
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,833
...before he tries to take nude photos
of his girlfriend.

261
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,128
He tried to take nude photos of you?

262
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,049
That's what you took from that?

263
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,053
The guy is married.

264
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,888
Oh, yeah.

265
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,141
I'm sor... Oh, that's terrible.

266
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,396
And you. If you are so okay with the way
things are between us, why are you jealous?

267
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,730
Well, that...

268
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,069
The important thing is
he's married and that's terrible.

269
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,573
Nice save, genius.

270
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,202
- Eggnog?
- Lactose.

271
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,249
It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog,
like, a half an hour ago.

272
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,922
Smooth.

273
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,592
Smoother than you.

274
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,430
Come on, it's Christmas.
Just give me this one.

275
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,307
Okay.

- Very good. Thanks for asking. Come on in.

You'll be pleased to know
I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

283
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,721
Okay. Here.

284
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,145
I should note,
I'm having some digestive distress...

285
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,401
...so if I excuse myself abruptly,
don't be alarmed.

286
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,245
Oh, a napkin.

287
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,165
Turn it over.

00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:15,510
"To Sheldon. Live long and prosper.

Leonard Nimoy."

290
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,978
Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the
napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

291
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:35,196
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?

292
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,700
Well...

00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,748
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
But look, he signed it.

294
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,709
Do you realize what this means?

295
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:55,967
All I need is a healthy ovum
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy.

00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,058
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin,

Oh.

A gift certificate for motorcycle lessons.

301
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,495
- Very thoughtful.
- Yeah, and I checked.

302
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,125
Not letting the bike fall on you

Sheldon, what did you do?

308
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,619
I know.

309
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,455
It's not enough, is it?

310
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,626
Here.

311
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,850
Leonard, look. Sheldon's hugging me.

312
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,646
It's a Saturnalia miracle.
