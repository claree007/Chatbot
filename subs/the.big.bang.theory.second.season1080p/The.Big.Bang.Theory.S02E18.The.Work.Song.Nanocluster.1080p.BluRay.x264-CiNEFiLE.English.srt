When I signed for the package, I was
deputized by the United Parcel Service...

33
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,033
...and entrusted with its final delivery.
I need you to acknowledge receipt...

34
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,620
...so that I'm fully indemnified
and no longer liable.

- Let me show you what I'm doing.
- Bailment...

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,553
...describes a relationship
in common law...

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,806
...where a physical possession
of personal property, or chattels...

42
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,560
...is transferred from one person, the bailer,
to another person, the bailee.

43
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,979
Yeah, yeah. Look, look.
I started a business.

44
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,983
Obviously not a cleaning business.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,987
No. I'm making flower barrettes. See?

46
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,158
I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one
for myself. All the girls at work wanted one.

47
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,661
I showed some to this lady who
runs a shop. She sells cards and jewelry.

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:47,416
She wanted to sell them, I said okay,
and in one week, I made a $156.

50
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:56,258
Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off,
I won't have to be a waitress anymore.

51
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,803
But then who will bring me
my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?

52
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,471
Another waitress?

53
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,474
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

54
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,643
And you're going to let her
handle my food?

55
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,146
Nancy. Her name is Nancy.

56
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,773
I think you're just making that up.

57
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,736
Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger,
okay? I just don't wanna be a waitress.

58
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,238
Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.

59
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,075
- Fine. Cheeseburger.
- Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.

60
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,913
So, what do you think?
I mean, this could be a business, right?

61
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,500
- How many of these can you make a day?
- Mm. About 20.

62
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,254
And how much profit do you make
per Penny Blossom?

63
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,467
- I don't know. Like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.
- No, of course you're not. All right.

64
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:45,265
Ten dollars a day times five days a week
times 52 weeks a year is $2600.

65
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,435
- That's all?
- Before taxes.

66
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,146
Well, I don't have to pay taxes
on this stuff.

67
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,066
The Internal Revenue Service
would strongly disagree.

68
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,654
But if you took advantage
of modern marketing techniques...

69
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,906
...and optimized
your manufacturing process...

70
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,033
...you might make this a viable business.

71
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,952
And you know about that stuff?

72
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,954

73
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,792

- Sheldon, hold on.

78
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,991
Could you maybe show me
how to make more money with this?

79
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,576
Of course I could.

80
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,370

81
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,247

82
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,336
Just to be clear here.

83
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,422
You're asking for my assistance.

84
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,673
Yes.

85
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,760
And you understand that will involve me
telling you what to do?

86
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,305
I understand.

87
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,851
And you're not allowed to be sarcastic
or snide to me while I'm doing so.

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,187
Okay.

89
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,231
Good.

90
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,945
Let's begin with the premise that everything
you've done up to this point is wrong.

91
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,449
- Oh, imagine that.
- Sarcasm. Goodbye.

92
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,743
No, I'm sorry. Wait. Please, come back.

93
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,023
- There. Done.
- All right.

94

Twelve minutes and 17 seconds.

95
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,443
Oh, pretty good, right?

96
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,820
That's 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour.

97
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,115
Based on your cost of materials
and your wholesale selling price...

98
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:12,037
...you'll effectively be paying yourself
$5. 19 a day.

99
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,705
A day?

100
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,667
There are children in a sneaker factory
in Indonesia who out-earn you.

101
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,629
That just can't be right.

102
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,131

- No, sorry.

103
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,801
- Would you like me to show my work?
- God, no, no.

104
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,720
- Just please tell me what to do about it.
- All right.

00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,775
The assembly line, of course.

108
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,946
Okay, if I'm not allowed to be snide,
you're not allowed to be condescending.

109
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,950
That wasn't a part of our original agreement
and I do not agree to it now.

How are we supposed to set up machines
and conveyor belts in my apartment?

111
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,373
You're thinking of
the moving assembly line.

112
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,043

but not excusable, mistake. Now...

...the moving assembly line, that was
introduced by Henry Ford in 1908.

00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,261
Let's think out of the box for a moment.

167
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,263
How about a molecular sieve?

168
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,390
<font color="#808080">HOWARD & LEONARD</font>:
Oh.

169
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,268
I've got a spaghetti strainer
in the kitchen.

170
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,814
Wow.

171
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,279
Hey, we could liberate some
microporous charcoal from the chem lab.

172
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,488
Oh, great.

173
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,532
Raj, why don't you go get the charcoal?

174
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,619
Leonard, start working
on some preliminary website designs.

175
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,372
I'll make space in our apartment so we
can move the manufacturing process.

176
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,543
- Well, what's wrong with my apartment?
- It's not my apartment.

177
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,545
Wait, wait, what am I gonna do?

178
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,298
Hey, it's your business.
Do whatever you want.

179
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,799
Oh.

180
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,594
Okay. Cool.

181
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,222
I'm gonna take a nap.

182
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,066
I'm still tweaking things a little bit, but this
will give the general idea of the website.

183
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,947
So, what do you guys think?

184
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,536
No, pretty much any way I say that
is gonna hurt his feelings.

185
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,208
Okay, what's wrong with it?

186
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,044
- What's wrong with it?
- Not you. I wasn't asking you.

187
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,799
- Penny?
- Well, it's a little juvenile.

188
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:20,261
I mean, it kind of looks like
the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.

189
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,263
No, it doesn't.

190
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,393
Please. Dateline could use it
to attract predators.

191
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,982
Penny, this is your enterprise,
so it's ultimately your decision.

192
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,069
But based on the quality of his work,
I'd strongly recommend...

193
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,238
...that we let Leonard go.

194
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,031
You wanna fire me?

195
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,743
What I want is irrelevant.
This is Penny's decision.

196
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,620
Penny?

197
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,124
Excuse me, if I did such a bad job,
then why do we already have orders?

198
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,918
- We do?
- Uh-huh. Look.

199
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,131
Mrs. Fiona Fondell from
Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.

200
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:00,635
- No kidding. Two?
- Uh-huh. Look at the comments.

201
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,389
"Thank you, Penny Blossoms.
These'll be perfect to cover my bald spots."

202
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,015
Aw.

203
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,977
Yeah. That is so sweet.

204
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,480
Camouflaging bald spots.
That's primarily a male concern.

205
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:15,066
Perhaps we could expand our market.

206
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,486
How are flower barrettes
gonna appeal to men?

207
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,200
- We add Bluetooth.
- Oh.

208
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,580
- Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

with Bluetooth?

00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,669

with Bluetooth.

Oh, another market to expand into.
Balding gay men.

217
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,530
And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.

218
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,616
We should get to work.

219
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,785
Wait, wait, why does it say
"one-day rush"?

220
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,037
Since when do we offer a one-day rush?

221
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,872
Amazon offers one-day rush.

222
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,125
Yeah, but they don't have to glue
the books together.

223
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,046
How are we gonna make
1000 Penny Blossoms in one day?

224
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,133
Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing.
I'm just web design.

225
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,302
I have to call them and cancel that order.

226
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,514
Excuse me, but was this not your goal?

227
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,267
Financial independence through
entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation?

228
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:35,230
Yeah, my brilliance and innovation,
of course, but still.

229
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,816
I just don't see how we can pull this off.

230
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,402
Okay, that, right there,
that equivocation and self-doubt...

231
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,655
...that is not the American spirit.

232
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,909
Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?
Did Jim Bowie?

233
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,871
They didn't quit. They were massacred...

234
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:57,001
...by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.

235
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,756
All right, let me put it this way.
Your gross receipts on this one order...

236
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,717

Your father's a gynecologist

We only had four servants.
And two of them were children.

- Yeah... No.

278

But, Sheldon, without your insight and

You're right, of course.

...you're gonna have to answer
to my mother.

284
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,410
Look at Planck's constant.
People say that's arbitrary.

285
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,496
That could not be less arbitrary.
If it varied even slightly...

286
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,416
...life as we know it would not exist. Bam!

287
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,382
Now, now, let's reconsider the entire
argument but with entropy reversed...

288
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,092
...and effect preceding cause.

289
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,263
So you are thinking of a universe.
It's not expanding from the center, no.

290
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,517
It is retreating
from a possibility space. Bam!
