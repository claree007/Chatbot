00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,435
...barbecue sauce,
bacon and cheese on the side.

168
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,437
Oh, I didn't tell you?

169
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,315
You're banished
from the Cheesecake Factory.

170
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,944
- Why?
- Well, you have three strikes.

171
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,697
One, coming in. Two, sitting down.

172
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,366
And three, I don't like your attitude.

173
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,120
You can't do that. Not only is it a violation
of California State Law...

174
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,290
...it flies directly in the face
of Cheesecake Factory policy.

175
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,168
Yeah, no, there's a new policy:
No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.

176
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,673
I bet we could sell that sign
all over Pasadena.

177
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,802
- Penny, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh.

178
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,097
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,474
Look, here's the thing.

180
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,145
I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible.

181
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,982
And he agrees that he was unreasonable
and out of line.

182
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,568
- Really? Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

183
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,653
Oh, just apologize to him, okay?

184
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,865
What? I'm not gonna apologize
to that nutcase.

185
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,702
Come on, it's easy.
He'll even tell you what to say.

186
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:25,165
Don't you get it? You keep going along
with his insanity, you're encouraging him.

187
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:30,003
We're not encouraging.
It's more like knuckling under.

188
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,174
I like hanging out but I'm not gonna
apologize for something I didn't do.

189
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,510
Well, actually, technically you did do it.

190
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,431
That's strike one, Leonard.

191
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,601
Here you go. Quesadilla.

192
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,894
Salad.

193
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,437
Here's your pizza.

194
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,857
And thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion
with my manager...

195
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:55,195
...barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue
sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.

196
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,489
Thank you.

197
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,199
Go ahead. Eat it.

198
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,331
I dare you.

199
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:17,425
That's it. There's the house.
I found America's top models!

200
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,177
- Are you sure?
- Look. On the roof.

201
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,639
Anaïs and Giselle are sunbathing.

202
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,433
European style.

203
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,936
You can recognize people
on Google Earth?

204
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:32,941
Of course not. I got a buddy of mine
at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

205
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,027
NORAD? You're using military aircraft?

206
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,906
It was already targeted
to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

207
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,409
I took it an hour out of its way, tops.

208
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,453
Okay, where is he?

209
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,997
Sheldon? I dropped him off
at the comic book store.

210
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,792
Here. Try and go online.

211
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,628
- Problem with the Wi-Fi?
- No, just try.

212
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,964
Greetings, hamburger-toucher.

213
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,219
You are probably wondering
why you cannot IM with your little friends...

214
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,305
...about how much you
heart various things.

215
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,809
Well, this recorded message
is alerting you...

216
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:12,021
...that I am putting an end to your
parasitic piggybacking upon our Wi-Fi.

217
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,315
If you want to remedy the situation...

218
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,445
...you can contact the phone company,
set up your own Wi-Fi and pay for it...

219
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,198
...or you may apologize to me.

220
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,537
- Well?
- I reiterate. Knuckle under.

221
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,831
Oh, no, no, no. It is on.

222
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,417
I'm gonna introduce your friend
to a world of hurt.

223
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,044
Oh, Penny,
you don't wanna get into it with Sheldon.

224
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:39,007
The guy's one lab accident away
from being a super villain.

225
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:44,888
I don't care. I was in junior rodeo. I can
hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.

226
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,976
No need to neuter the nerd.
I can get you back online.

227
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,394
There, see?

228
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,521
Problem solved.

229
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,857
Voilà.

Hello, puny insects.

231
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,781
As a consequence of your efforts
to circumvent my will...

232
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,743
...everyone is awarded
one additional strike.

233
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,746
Thanks a lot, Howard.

I'm the one who has to take the class again.

Oh!

Hello.

237
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,515
Time to do your laundry, huh?

238
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,391
Saturday night.

239
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,477
Saturday is laundry night.

240
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,312
I know.

241
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,065
Every Saturday at 8:15.

242
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,943
Easy to anticipate.

243

<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
What are you implying?

I'm implying
that you're a creature of habit.

00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,954
And if something were to prevent you from
doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15...

246
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,373
...you might find it...

247
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,583
...unpleasant.

248
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,758
Knuckle under, my ass.

249
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,225
Oh, no.

250

00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,401
No problem.

253
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,280
I'll just do my laundry another night.

254
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,906
Another night?

255
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,950
Well, I guess you can try...

256
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:34,873
...but deep inside your heart you'll know
that laundry night is always Saturday night.

257
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,964
Woman, you are playing with forces
beyond your ken.

258
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,175
Yeah, well,
your Ken can kiss my Barbie.

259
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,140
Sheldon?

260
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,142
Sheldon? Sheldon?

261
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,939
Yes?

262
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,524
Where are my clothes?

263
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,985
- Your clothes?
- Yes. I left them in the washers.

264
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,029
I went to get them,
they were gone.

265
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:12,118
Really? Despite the sign that says:
"Do not leave laundry unattended"?

266
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,037
Sheldon, where are my clothes?

267
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:18,291
You know, I do recall
seeing some female undergarments.

268
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,877
Where was that? Oh, yes.

269
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,629
Earlier this evening...

270
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,884
...I happened to gaze out the window
and a brassiere caught my eye.

271
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,345
Do those look familiar?

272
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,848
How the hell did you get them up
on that telephone wire?

273
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,603
When you understand the laws of physics,
Penny, anything is possible.

274
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,607
And may I add:
Mua-ha-ha.

275
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,235
- Get them down.
- Apologize.

276
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,695
- Never.
- Then I suggest...

277
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,239
...you get a very long stick
and play panty piñata.

278
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,076
Look, wait, Sheldon.

279
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,911
This has gotten out of hand. Okay.

280
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,872
I've done some stupid things,
you've done some stupid things.

281
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,249
How about call it even,
move on with our lives?

282
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,918
I've done no stupid things.

283
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,420
- Look, you've gotta meet me halfway here.
- I am.

284
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,423

remember when I said it was on?

288

Well, now it's junior rodeo on.

289
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,317
Oh, not junior rodeo.

291
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,615

She ruined laundry night.

304
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,957

00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,486
Here's your laundry.

338
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,448
I rescind your strikes
and you are no longer banished.

339
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,951
Can I sit wherever I want?

340
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,954
No, no, no.

341
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,832
Never mind. Never mind.
That's not important.

342
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,959
Sheldon, this was big of you.

343
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,628
- Thank you. I really appreciate it.
- Thank you.

344
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,840
- Good night, Sheldon.
- Penny?

345
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,550
Yes?

346
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,594
Well played.

347
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,515
- Thank you.
- Just remember...

348
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,436
...with great power
comes great responsibility.

349
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,398
Understood.

351
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,664
Can I help you?

352
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,500
Yes, we're here to fix the cable.

353
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,587
I think we have satellite.

354
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,840
That's what I meant.

355
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,260
Oh. Okay. Come on in.

356
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,853
She's taller than all the women
in my family combined.
