3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:12,970
- Good morning, Leonard.
- Aah!

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,598
- Uh-huh.
- We have to stop by Pottery Barn...

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,102
...on the way to work.
I bought these Star Wars sheets.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,898
They turned out to be much too stimulating
to be compatible with a good night's sleep.

7
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,319
I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,031
I'm not going to work.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,660
Just because your career's been stagnant
for a few years, that's no reason to give up.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,456
Sheldon, I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser...

11
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,708
...for my x-ray-diffraction experiment.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,711
Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,630
- No.
- Then you can drive. Let's go.

14

<font color="#E86CE4">(LEONARD SIGHS)</font>

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,179
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and
you'd have to make other arrangements?

16
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,597
- You did.
- And?

17
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,557
I didn't.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,768
Let's go.

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,853
Good night, Sheldon.

20
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,773
- But how am I going to get to work?
- Take the bus.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,358
But I can't take the bus.
They don't have seat belts.

22
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,862
And they won't let you lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords.

23
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,157
You tried to lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?

24
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,910
I didn't try, I succeeded.

25
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,706
But for some reason, it alarmed the other
passengers and I was asked to de-bus.

26
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,542
Oh, you're a big boy. You'll figure it out.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,544
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

28
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,006
Now take me
to return my Star Wars sheets.

29
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,009
Penny?

30
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,011
Penny? Penny?

31
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,389
Sheldon, what is it?

32
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,642
Leonard's asleep.

33
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,937
Thanks for the update.

34
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,022
No, wait.

35
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,816
You have to drive me to work.

36
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,027
Yeah, I really don't think I do.

37
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,988
But I don't drive
and I can't take the bus.

38
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,866
You'll be fine as long as
you don't do that bungee thing.

39
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,326
Penny.

40
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,413
Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?

41
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,543
Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.

42
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,337
Then I hereby invoke
what I'm given to understand...

43
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,882
...is an integral part
of the implied covenant of friendship.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,555
The favor.

45
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,266
Oh, dear God.

46
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,687
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
I was interrupting your morning prayers.

47
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,149
When you're done, we'll go.

48
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,011
Thank you for driving me to work.

49
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,971
You know this is my day off, Sheldon?

50
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,599
Oh, good,
I'm not keeping you from anything.

51
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,771
- Your check-engine light is on.
- Mm-hm.

52
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,526
Typically that's an indicator to,
you know, check your engine.

53
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,487
It's fine. It's been on for like a month.

54
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,659
Well, actually, that would be all the more
reason to, you know, check your engine.

55
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,955
- Sheldon, it's fine.
- If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on.

56
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:31,001
That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

57
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,878
Maybe the light's broken.

58
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,132
Is there
a check-the-check-engine-light light?

59
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,801
Oh.

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,511
What?

61
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:45,307
Studies have shown that performing tasks
such as eating, talking on a phone...

62
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,393
...or drinking coffee while driving
reduces one's reaction time...

63
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,646
...by the same factor
as an ounce of alcohol.

64
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,357
- Do you have any alcohol?
- Of course not.

65
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,484
Too bad.

66
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,156
- You're going up Euclid Avenue?
- Mm-hm.

67
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,991
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

68
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,785
Well, good for Leonard.

69
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,497
Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies,
but it has speed bumps...

70
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,709
...which increase point-to-point drive time,
making it the less efficient choice.

71
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,213
But you have the con.

72
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,174
Oh!

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,680
If you're not going to slow down for
the speed bumps, I withdraw my objection.

74
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,016
Here's a fun question.

75
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,727
Do you know
what the most common street name is?

76
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,438
- No.
- The answer's tricky.

77
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,691
It's Second Street.

78
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,567
You'd think it would be First Street.

79
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,071
In most towns, First Street eventually
gets renamed to something else.

80
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,781
Like Main Street...

81
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,283
...Broad Street...

82
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,535
...Michigan Avenue.

83
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,453
Leonard and I
often use our commute time...

84
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,248
...to exercise our minds
with brain teasers like that.

85
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,042
We also play games.

86
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,545
Would you like to play one?

87
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,089
- No.
- Oh, come on, it's fun.

88
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,092
Whoo! Another bump.

89
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,055
Okay. Uh, I'll say an element
and, uh, you say an element...

90
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,726
...whose name starts
with the last letter of the one I said, okay?

91
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,936
I'll start.

92
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,231
"Helium."

93
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,737
Now, you could say, "Mercury."

94
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,447
That would give me a Y.

95
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,241
Ooh, very clever. That's a tough one.

96
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,076
So I go with "ytterbium"...

97
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,786
...which gets you back to M.

98
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,580
So you go, "Molybdenum."

99
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,749
And I say, "Magnesium."

100
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,208
And you say, "Manganese."

101
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,169
And I say, "Europium."

102
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,962
And you're left with "mendelevium."

103
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,090
And there are no more M's,
because I believe that meitnerium...

104
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,178
...should still be called eka-iridium.
So congratulations, you win.

105
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,768
Do you wanna go again?

106
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,812
How about we just have
a little quiet time now?

107
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,439
All right.

109
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,364
I'm sorry.
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance...

110
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,200
...regarding the check-engine light
to be very troubling.

111
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,872
Get out.

112
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,418
I have to tell you that while I do have
a theoretical understanding...

113

...of an internal-combustion engine...

114
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,173
...I'm not sure
I'm capable of performing diagnostics.

115
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,175
I said, "Get out."

116
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,135
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

117
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,777
Oh, Leonard, there you are.

118
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm ready to go home.

119
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,323
I just got here.

120
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,409
Good. Perfect timing.

121
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,329
Sheldon, I told you, I only have access
to the free-electron laser at night.

122
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,832
- I can't drive you for the next few weeks.
- No.

123
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,168
You said you couldn't drive me to work.
This is from work.

124
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,504
Howard, help me out here.

125
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,508
No, just for the fun of it,
I'm gonna take his side.

126
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,594
Now, how do you propose I get home?

127
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,098
- How did you get here in the first place?
- Penny.

128
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,017
But I sense that's no longer an option.

129
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,603
Look, I need to get to the laser lab.

130
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,441
You're just gonna have to find
someone else to take you home.

131
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,366

Why did Howard leave you
in the middle of the road, anyway?

136
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,554
We had a difference of opinion.

137
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,222
Over what?

138
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,892
Whether or not he was trying to kill me.

139
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,269
For the record, I maintain he was.

140
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,273
- Where are you going?
- I'm taking you home.

141
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,567
But I'm not going home. It's Wednesday.

142
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,571
Wednesday is New Comic Book Day.
We have to go to the comic-book store.

143
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,575
And then we have to stop at Souplantation.
It's Creamy Tomato Soup Day.

144
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,078
And RadioShack.
There's a sale on triple-A batteries.

145
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,123
We have to go to Pottery Barn
and return my Star Wars sheets.

146
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,250
I have a better idea.

147
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,837
You wanna go to Pottery Barn first?

148
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,601
Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?

149
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,902
Maybe if I turn off the nightlight,
I can keep the sheets.

150
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,457

...you know that we care about you.

157

And it's because we care about you

00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,448
And RadioShack.

172
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,074
Fine.

173
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,703
- And the comic-book store.
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: All right.

174
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,205
I wanna go to the comic-book store.

175
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,977
I like comic books.

176
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,069
I still don't see
why I need a driver's license.

177
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,280
Albert Einstein
never had a driver's license.

178
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,535
Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make me
wet myself at 40 miles an hour.

179
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,997
Yeah, and I never wanted
to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts.

180
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,838
You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just
get a license at 16 like everybody else?

181
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,716
I was otherwise engaged.

182
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,760
Doing what?

183
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,263
Examining perturbative amplitudes
in N=4 supersymmetric theories...

184
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,100
...leading to a re-examination
of the ultraviolet properties...

185
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:29,646
...of multi-loop N=8 supergravity
using modern twistor theory.

186
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,610
Well, how about when you were 17?

187
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,780
Take this to the testing area.
Name at the top.

188
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,366
Sign the bottom, answer
the questions, bring it back. Next.

189
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,040
Application?

190
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,836
I'm actually more of a theorist.

191
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,382
The application in your hand.
Give it to her.

192
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,008
Oh.

193
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,222
Take this to the testing area.
Name at the top.

194
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,100
Sign the bottom, answer the questions,
bring it back. Next.

195
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,979
Excuse me, but I have some concerns
about these questions.

196
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,815
Look at that sign up there.

197
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,610
- Yes?
- Does it say, "I give a damn"?

198
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,240
- No.
- That's because I don't.

199
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,452
Just look.
See, this first question makes no sense.

200
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,247
Look, "How many car lengths should you
leave in front of you when driving?"

201
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,624
There's no possible way to answer that.

202
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,378
A car length is not
a standardized unit of measure.

203
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,047
Look at the sign.

204
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,718
- Sheldon, it's C. Just put down C.
- I don't need your help, Penny.

205
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,637
- Listen to that little girl, honey. Put C. Next.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: No, no.

206
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,223
Wait, no, hang on.
Take a look at this next question.

207
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,894
Sheldon,
why are you arguing with the DMV?

208
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,396
How else are they going to learn?

209
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,025
Look, question two:

210
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,444
"When are roadways most slippery?"

211
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,988
There are three answers,
none of which are correct.

212
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,201
The correct answer is, "When covered by
liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient...

213
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,120
...to static friction between the tire
and the road to zero.

214
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,540
But not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

215
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,339
Here's your learner's permit. Go away.

216
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:24,093
But I'm not done. I have many
additional concerns about these questions.

217
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,597
- Don't make me climb over this counter.
- All right, come on. Let's go.

218
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,892
<font color="#808080">WOMAN</font>:
Next.

219
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,644
Aced it.

220
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,150
Okay. That's it. Let's boot it up.

221
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,568
Booting.

222
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,196
This is a state-of-the-art simulator.

223
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,949
I adapted it from something
a friend designed for the Army.

224
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,034
Is that why I appear to be in Fallujah...

225
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,829
...behind the wheel
of an up-armored Humvee?

226
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,915
I haven't configured it yet.

227
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:58,795
Let's see. Bradley tank.
Transport truck. Batmobile.

228
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,256
- Ooh!
- No.

229
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,969
Here we go. Red 2006 Ford Taurus
on the streets of Pasadena.

230
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,637
Uh...

231
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,056
- What?
- Statistically, red cars...

232
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,767
...are stopped by police
far more often than any other color.

233
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,728
I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.

234
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,606
Fine, what color do you want?

235
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,694
You know the pale blue
of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?

236
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,948
Before it was digitally remastered.

237
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,159
Black it is.

238
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:36,124
Okay. Now, what you wanna do first
is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.

239
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,293
I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.

240
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,422
Okay, fasten your seat belt.

241
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,139
Click.

242
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,143
- Are there air bags?
- You don't need air bags.

243
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,020

244
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,939

why my little toes and lateral incisors...

- Yeah, wait, no, I'm not gonna so far...

But I am convinced
that the reason I cannot master...

...the plebeian task of driving
is because I'm not meant to.

Yes, you are.

- No, no.
