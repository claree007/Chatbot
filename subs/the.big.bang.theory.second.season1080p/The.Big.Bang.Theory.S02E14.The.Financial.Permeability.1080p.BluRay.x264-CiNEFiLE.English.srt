1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,046
Hmm.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,132
The problem appears to be unsolvable.

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:10,384
Maybe we could run
some computer simulations.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,803
There are many variables.
It would take forever.

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,180
We've gotta be missing something.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,598
Okay. Let's start again.

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,227
The movie is playing here at 7:20,
here at 7:40...

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,646
...<font color="#808080">here at 8</font>: 10, and here at 8:45.

9
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,691
All right.
These theaters have to be eliminated.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,319
Why? They're state of the art:
digital projection, surround sound.

11
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,156
Yes, but they have no Icee machines.

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,076
Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.

13
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,663
What about the multiplex here?
The seats are terrific.

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:44,585
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines.
No lumbar support can compensate for that.

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,298
It's gonna take an hour to eat and I don't
see a Sheldon-approved restaurant...

16
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,884
...proximate
to a Sheldon-approved theater.

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,553
- We could eat after the movie.
- Unacceptable.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,223
The delay would result in tomorrow
morning's bowel movement at work.

19
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,561
Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,315
We smuggle Slurpees, which are
essentially Icees, in under our coats...

21
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,903
...after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.

22
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,446
Wow.

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,615
- I don't see how we missed that.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Excuse me?

24
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,368
In what universe are Slurpees Icees?

25
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,663
That's how we missed it.

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,666
Would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis...

27
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,711
...to create an emergency
ad hoc Slurpee-Icee equivalency?

28
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,215
Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,593
Okay, I guess we only have one option.

30
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,386
Yup, I don't see any way around it.

31
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,597
- Bye, Sheldon.
- See you.

32
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,182
Later, dude.

33
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,065
They're right. It was the only option.

34
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,638
- Oh. Oh. Shut the door, Shut the door.
- Why?

35
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,390
Just do it.

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,605
- Get inside and shut the door.
- Well, you didn't specify.

37
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,903
- Is Leonard around?
- He went to the movies without me.

38
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,406
It was the only option.

39
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,001
I'm sorry, I don't know understand
which social situation this is.

40
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,295
Could you give me some guidance
how to proceed?

41
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,504
<font color="#E86CE4">(SIGHS)</font>

42
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,923
The building manager's showing
an apartment downstairs...

43
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,468
- ...and I haven't paid my rent.
- Oh, I see.

44
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,804
I'm not comfortable harboring
a fugitive...

45
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,849
...from the 2311
North Los Robles Corporation.

46
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,810
It's no big deal.
I'm just a little behind on my bills.

47
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,897
They cut back my hours
at the restaurant and my car broke down.

48
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,273
If you recall...

49
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,235
...I pointed out the "check engine" light
to you several months ago.

50
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:20,115
No, the "check engine" light is fine.
It's still blinking away.

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,327
It's the stupid engine
that stopped working.

52
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,288
It cost me, like, $1200 to fix it.

53
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:32,127
You know, it occurs to me. You could solve
all your problems by obtaining more money.

54
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,050
Yes, it occurs to me too.

55
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,802
Hang on a moment.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,189
Here. Take some.

58
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,107
Pay me back when you can.

59
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,984
Wow, you got a lot of money in there.

60
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,612
That's why it's guarded by snakes.

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,991
- Take some.
- Don't be silly.

62
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm never silly.

63
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,538
- Here.
- No, I can't.

64
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,582
- Don't you need money?
- Well, yeah, but...

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,125
This is money I'm not using.

66
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,460
But what if you need it?

67
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,464
My expenses account for 46.9 percent
of my after-tax income.

68
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,300
The rest is divvied up
between a small savings account...

69
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,678
...this deceptive container
of peanut brittle...

70
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,931
...and the hollowed-out buttocks
of a superhero action figure...

...who shall remain nameless
for his own protection.

72
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,856
Or her own protection.

73
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,153
- Take some.
- Really? I mean, are you sure?

74
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,197
I see no large upcoming expenditures.

75
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,825
Unless they develop technology
to fuse my skeleton...

76
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,577
...with Adamantium like Wolverine.

77
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,123
Are they working on that?

78
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,500
I sincerely hope so.

79
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,214
Okay. Well, thank you.

80
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:14,354
Hmm.

81
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,774
Ah, hmm.

82
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,155
Oh, God, no, I can't.

83
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,366
Look, Sheldon, honey, I don't want things
to be weird between us.

84
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,120
Won't it also be weird if I have to say
hello to you on my way to work...

85
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,166
...and you're living in a refrigerator box
and washing your hair with rain water?

86
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,377
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

87
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,004
Of course you will.

88
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,840
It's impossible to pay me back
sooner than you can.

89
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:47,179
Assuming you've subscribed to a linear
understanding of time and causality.

90
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,891
I'm regretting this already.

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,230
You know,
I've given the matter some thought...

92
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:01,902
...and I think I'd be willing to be a house
pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.

93
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,614
Interesting.

94
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,699
Ask me why.

95
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,951
Do I have to?

96
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,829
Of course. That's how you move
a conversation forward.

97
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,956
Why?

98
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,459
The learning opportunities
would be abundant.

99
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,710
Additionally...

100
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,463
...I like having my belly scratched.

101
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,634
- Hey, Penny. How was work?
- Great.

102
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,805
I hope I'm a waitress at
the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.

103
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,348
Was that sarcasm?

104
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,141
No.

105
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,518
Was that sarcasm?

106
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,478
Yes.

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,855
- Was that sarcasm?
- Stop it.

108
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,650
Penny?

109
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,069
- You appear to have a package here.
- Oh, thanks.

110
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,821
It must be the beret I ordered.

111
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,740
A couple of months ago.
It was back-ordered.

112
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,243
Did you know the beret
is an example...

113
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,996
...of a piece of women's fashion
adapted from male military uniforms?

114
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,000
Another fascinating example
is the epaulet.

115
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,588
He's not lying.
He does find that fascinating.

116
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,674
Okay, look, whatever.

117
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,844
It's not like I'm running up and down
the streets buying berets.

118
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,264
I bought one a month ago
when it was back-ordered. It finally arrived.

119
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,849
- All right?
- All right.

120
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,810
Oh, my God,
would you just get off my case?

121
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,231
- Weird.
- Oh, good.

122
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,651
That was an unusual interaction.
I wasn't sure.

123
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,697
- You guys have an argument?
- No.

124
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,533
You clearly did something
to aggravate her.

- Uh, don't worry about it. It's my treat.
- No, really. How much?

It's whatever. Ten, $11.

I wanted something different. So sue me.

00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,374
Where I won't be interrogated
like a criminal.

169
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,923
I forgot my fortune cookie.

170
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,096
In case either of you
have larceny in your heart...

171
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,349
...you should know that I've moved
my money out of the snake can.

172
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,898
But if you're ever short, there's always
a couple of 50s in Green Lantern's ass.

173
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,365
<font color="#E86CE4">(KNOCKING ON DOOR)</font>

174
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,161
- Hey.
- Hey.

175
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,371
A little mood lighting, huh?

176
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,750
Yeah. When I didn't pay my bill,
the Department of Water and Power...

177
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,669
...thought I would enjoy the ambience.

178
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,298
Yeah, they're very considerate that way.

179
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,636
I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent.
Then I had, like, $14 left over.

180
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,264
Fourteen dollars, huh?

181
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,976
Put it back in your pocket
or I'll find another place to put it.

182
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,480
Back in the pocket it goes.

183
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,525
Look, you do understand that Sheldon
doesn't care when he gets the money back.

184
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,861
It's actually one
of the few idiosyncrasies...

185
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,031
...that doesn't make you wanna,
you know, kill him.

186
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,909
Yeah, well,
that's not really my big problem.

187
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,329
You're a little behind on your bills.
Everybody gets behind on bills.

188
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,665
Yeah, I know, it's just...
This wasn't the plan.

189
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,667
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

190
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,086
Hey, well, what was the plan?

191
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,547
Um, waitress for six months
and then become a movie star.

192
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,550
Uh-huh.

193
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,885
Was there a Plan B?

194
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,679
TV star.

195
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,475
Well, it's probably not as bad as you think.
Let's take a look.

196
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,103
Maybe we can find some corners to cut.

197
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,604
Oh, here's something.

198
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,441
If you don't have electricity,
then you probably don't need cable.

199
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,113
Just a suggestion.

200
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,866
A hundred and seventy dollars
for acting classes?

201
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,245
Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes.
I'm a professional actress.

202
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,454
Oh.

203
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,248
You had an acting job
where you got paid?

204
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,457
<font color="#E86CE4">(SCOFFS)</font>

205
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,168
That is not the definition of professional.

206
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,632
Actually, it kind of is. Let's keep looking.

207
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,636
Whoa.

208
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,432
What's $1800
to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?

209
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,267
Oh, that's nothing.

210
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,476
Nothing?

211
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:13,606
It sounds like you got caught speeding
going 4000 miles an hour.

212
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,483
Well, remember Kurt?

213
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,777
Your ex-boyfriend?

214
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,239
Yeah, he got arrested
for taking a whiz on a cop car.

215
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,490
- What?
- He was drunk.

216
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,326
I would hope so.

217
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,038
He had a bunch of outstanding tickets
and a bench warrant, so I...

218
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,790
You know, I paid his fines.

219
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,000
Did he pay you back?

220
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,251
No, but he will.

221
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,755
And that's based
on the inherent credit-worthiness...

222
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,633
...of people who get drunk
and urinate on police vehicles?

223
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,012
Leonard, I'm not gonna call up Kurt
and ask him for money.

224
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,346
Oh?

225
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,015
What are you gonna do?

226
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,351
I don't know but I might have to find
a cheaper place to live.

227
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,312
Oh, no.

228
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,815
No, you don't wanna do that.

229
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,025
Why not?

230
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,694
Uh, moving is a big deal.

231
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,157
Uh, you... You have to go
to the supermarket and get boxes...

232
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,952
...and if they're not clean
then your books smell like melons and it's...

233
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,873
Why don't you just get a roommate
and stay here?

234
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,333
Well, do you know anybody?

235
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,921
Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon
wouldn't mind moving in with you.

236
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,051
Oh, Leonard, honey,
if we started living together...

237
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,221
...I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.

238
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,974
Really?

239
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,562
And you thought my acting lessons
were a waste of money.

240
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,738
Ugh. This moo shu pork's burning a hole
through my duodenum.

241
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,534
Tsk, tsk. Leviticus 11:3.

242
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:52,705
That which parteth the hoof and cheweth
the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.

243
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,379
Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad Gita
every time you scarf down a Whopper?

244
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:08,012
- Hey, what's going on?
- We're on a quest to the Valley of Fire.

245
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,932
You want the Valley of Fire?
It's right here.

246
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,853
Hey, you guys wanna go
on a real live quest?

247
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,397
Outside? I just made cocoa.

248
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,899
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

249
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,442
What is it?

250
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,862
Do you guys remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt?

251
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,283
Yeah, that's him.

252
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,954
Uh, it turns out he owes Penny a lot
of money and I'm gonna go get it from him.

253
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,789
Who's with me?

254
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,378
Ooh, double sixes.

255
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,047
Really?
You're just gonna let me go by myself?

256
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,633
Oh, cool, I got a sword.

257
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,552
I could use some help.

258
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,137
Here.

259
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,348
You guys are unbelievable.

260
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,685
You play a game to simulate adventure,
but when there's adventure...

261
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,979
...in the real world you just wimp out.

262
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,232
Leonard, do you not recall the last time
we visited this gentleman?

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,943
We returned home without pants.

264
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,488
- I do.
- Are you sure?

265
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,908
Because your proposal suggests
that you don't.

266
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,409
I'm not afraid of him.

267
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,995
All right.
Leonard fairly calls the question:

268
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,331
Who is in favor
of abandoning our game...

269
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,334
...and confronting
Penny's steroid-infused ex-boyfriend...

270
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,921
...in a suicidal mission
to extract money from him?

271
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,508
Say hi to Kurt for us.

272
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,928
Excuse me.

273
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,805
When Frodo left the Shire
to take the one ring to Mordor...

274
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,933
...didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go?

275
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,309
- They did.
- Well?

276
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,937
They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.

277
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,024
Plus, no one stole their pants.

278
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,151
Fine.

279
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,696
Enjoy your little game.
I'll make this quest on my own.

280
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,031
Leonard, wait.

281
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,992
Take a jacket, it's shpritzing a little.

282
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,954
You guys suck.

283
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,042
Come on, please. He's so big.

284
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,674
- Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
- Yes. Koothrappali's going to wet himself...

285
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,636
...I'm gonna throw up, Sheldon's
gonna run away, and you're going to die.

286
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,515
Shall we synchronize our watches?

287
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,142
Guys, there are four of us
and one of him.

288
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,187
Which means his triumph
will be even larger.

289
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,857
Minstrels will write songs about him.

290
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,736
Okay, how about this? I'll do the talking,
you stand behind me and try to look...

291
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,071
...formidable.

292
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,121
I should've peed before we left.

293
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,999
Yeah?

294
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,921
- Hi, Kurt.
- Lenny, right?

295
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,675
I don't really go by Lenny,
but that's okay. Um...

296
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,594
You remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.

297
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,763
No.

298
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,182
- What do you want?
- You don't remember me?

299
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,518
- How could he not remember?
- Sheldon, not now.

300
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,520
I remember him.

301
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,898
Okay, here it is.
Penny's in kind of a financial jam...

302
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,444
...and the money you owe her would
go a long way to solving her problems.

303
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,948
- And she sent you to get it from me?
- No, she's too proud to ask for the money.

304
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,951
I, on the other hand,
feel you should honor your debt.

305
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,578
You do?

306
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,709
"Feel" is kind of a...
It's a strong word. Uh...

307
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,545
But I just... I think it'd be a nice gesture
on your part.

308
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,797
She'll get it when she gets it.

309
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,096
Well, there you go. Problem solved.

310
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,559
A successful quest. Now let's find
a gas station with a clean bathroom.

311
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,145
No, the problem isn't solved.

312
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,396
He just blew us off.

313
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,482
I've got it.

314
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,819
He didn't remember me, because the last
time we met I was in a Halloween costume.

315
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,491
- Come on, Leonard, let's go.
- No. You can leave if you want to.

316
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,827
- I'm gonna see this through.
- Okay.

317
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,127
I guess technically that was my fault.

318
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,135
I'm not leaving here
without Penny's money.

319
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,889
What happened to your backup?

320
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,558
I don't need backup.

321
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,185
I have right on my side.

322
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,276
And I'm wearing cargo shorts
under my pants.

323
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,364
Congratulations.

324
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,616
You may not have succeeded
in getting cash...

325
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,702
...but you did secure
a formal acknowledgment of the debt.

326
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,461
Maybe we should have your head
notarized.

327
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,967
If anybody cares, I still have to pee.

328
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,975
Hey.

329
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,186
- Is Sheldon here?
- Yeah, hang on.

330
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,396
Sheldon.

331
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,314
- Nice hat.
- You know?

332
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,568
It's kind of a fashionable look
these days.

333
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,737
Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.

334
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,574
- Hello, Penny.
- Sheldon, here is your money.

00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,701
Thank you very much, it helped a lot.

336
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,162
Sarcasm?

337
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,122
- No.
- Darn.

338
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,624
I can't seem to get the hang of that.

339
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,212
Hey, I know it's none of my business,
but where did the money come from?

340
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,464
Well, I cut back my expenses
like you said...

341
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,758
...and picked up more hours
at the restaurant.

342
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,595
The biggest thing was, out of the blue,
Kurt shows up...

343
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,430
...and gives me the money he owes me.

345
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:44,891
Really?

346
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,310
Did he say why?

347
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:51,564
Yes. He said he was feeling guilty
and wanted to do what was right.

349
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,402
That's it?

350
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:02,658
Did he give any reason
as to why he came to this moral epiphany?

351
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,329
Nope. I just think he's really changed.

352
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,959
We're having dinner tomorrow night.
And I get to wear my new beret. Ha, ha.

353
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,587
Bye, guys.

354
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,297
Bye.

355
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,137
Well done, Leonard.

356
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,849
The true hero doesn't seek adulation.

357
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,686
He fights for right and justice
simply because it's his nature.

Penny's hooking up
with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend...

359
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,984
...and I have indelible ink
on my forehead.

360
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:41,197
That's your badge of honor. They're your,
uh, warrior's wound, if you will.

361
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,865
I was wrong.

362
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,202
Minstrels will write songs about you.

363
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,538
Great.

There once was a brave lad named Leonard

365
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,754
With a fi-fi-fiddle dee-dee

366
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,757
He faced a fearsome giant
