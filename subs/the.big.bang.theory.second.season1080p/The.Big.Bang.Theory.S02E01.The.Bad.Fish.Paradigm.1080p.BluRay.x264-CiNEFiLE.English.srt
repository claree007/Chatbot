1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,420
So, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,839
It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,259
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:15,264
- Well, that's very interesting.
- It's also not pink and has no berries.

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,934
Yeah, but it doesn't really
answer my question.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,729
- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?

7
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,397
Ah.

8
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,983
- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,277
- So gas.
- Yeah, got it.

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,947
Well, good night.

11
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,631
- What are you doing?
- There was a draft.

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,592
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
I didn't feel a draft.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,680
- Why don't we just go into your...?
- Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,766
Maybe we should
slow things down a little.

15
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,477
No, I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.

16
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,270
No, I know.

17
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,607
I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.

18
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,816
Okay. Sure. No problem.

19
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,277
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...

20
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,571
...and when we want to get there?

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,617
And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

22
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,454
Solve for R.

23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,123
Or we could just wing it.

24
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,126
That might work too.

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,837
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

26
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,761
He's coming. Screen saver.

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,392
Oh, hey, Leonard.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,187
- How was your date?
- Bite me.

29
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,859
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

30
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,069
They were clever.

31
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,614
They exploited my complete lack of interest
in what you were doing.

32
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,910
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine...

33
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,704
...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...

34
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,833
...this right here is the black box.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,794
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

36
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,796
She said she wants to slow things down.

37
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,715
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

38
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,719
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

39
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,722
I'm going to slow down and savor it."

40
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,393
No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad...

41
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,063
...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

42
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,067
- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.

43
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,027
Oh, really?
Did you make a second date?

44
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:39,324
- Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.
- Oh, even I know that's lame.

45
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,327
Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.

46
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:46,039
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

47
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,583
Where could I have gone wrong?

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,919
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

49
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:55,174
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet
we could get her to come home with us."

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,095
Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into."

51
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,682
- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, because they don't work.

52
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,311
They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

53
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,855
Sadly, that's my home-run swing.

54
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,524
Look, everything went fine.

55
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,737
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

56
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,239
That woman across the hall is into me.

57
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,450
Let's go to the tape.

58
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,537
Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.

59
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,083
No change in respiration, pupils undilated,
no flushing of the chest.

60
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,294
Nice close-up, by the way.

61
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,756
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.

62
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,259
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

63
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,470
That's not a bad sign.

64
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,224
Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

65
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,644
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

66
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,314
I'm not there,
because I'm taking things slow.

67
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,943
Which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

68
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,155
And take down that camera.

69
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,660
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

70
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,289
Give him time.

71
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,491
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

72
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,537
Yeah, FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2, so colors only.

73
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,748
Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.

74
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,252
- So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
- Thanks.

75
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,214
Well, good Lord.

76
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,135
Why don't you just take your clothes down
to the river and beat them with a rock?

77
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,475
Sheldon, may I ask you a question?

78
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,604
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

79
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,441
All right, I heard "yes," so...

80
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,901
Okay, here's my question:

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,073
Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?

82
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,619
Well, I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

83
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,166
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

84
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:39,880
No, I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

85
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,257
Oh! Well, a few years ago...

86
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,470
...he did go out with a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.

87
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:51,975
- How is that not a brainiac?
- Well, for one thing, she was French.

88
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,605
For another, it was literature.

89
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,029
So...

90
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,616
Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...

91
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,202
...he'll eventually get bored with me?

92
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,168
- That depends.
- On what?

93
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,254
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

94
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,672
No.

95
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,841
Do you speak Klingon?

96
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,426
No.

97
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,304
- You know any card tricks?
- Okay.

98
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,685
I get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...

99
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:40,399
...who felt so insecure, that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

100
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,109
Why would you lie about that?

101
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,028
He was going on about this college
and that grad school...

102
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,698
...and I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

103
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:53,036
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community-college graduate"?

104
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,460
There are a lot of successful people
in this country...

105
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,462
...who are community-college graduates.

106
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,840
Yeah, but you are neither.

107
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,052
Right. Okay, look,
this is between you and me.

108
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,347
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

109
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,393
- You're asking me to keep a secret?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,727
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,148
You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...

112
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:25,277
...so that I could choose whether I wanted
to accept the covenant of secret-keeping.

113
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,531
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

114
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,325
What?

115
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,787
Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...

116
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,125
...not only about what one says, but about
facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.

117
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,877
When I try to deceive...

118
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:46,715
...I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.

119
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,054
It's a joke.

120
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:57,017
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick, the bloodsucking arachnid...

121
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,644
...and tic, the involuntary
muscular contraction.

122
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,229
<font color="#E86CE4">(CHUCKLES)</font>

123
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,442
I made it up myself.

124
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,283
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

125
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,453
- Physiologically impossible.
- Oh, Sheldon, please.

126
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,622
Look, I'm asking you as a friend.

127
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,334
You're saying that friendship
contains within it...

128
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,086
...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

129
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,673
- Well, yeah.
- Interesting.

130
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,635
One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with this:

131
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,887
When did we become friends?

132
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,099
I.e., I couldn't become Green Lantern...

133
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,268
...unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa.

134
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,438
Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...

135
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,607
...I could be Batman.

136
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,321
- You could be Batman?
- Sure.

137
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,572
<font color="#E86CE4">(IN DEEP VOICE)</font>
I'm Batman.

138
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,782
<font color="#E86CE4">(IN NORMAL VOICE)</font>
See?

139
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,244
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

140
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,995
- Hi, Penny.
- Hey.

141
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,750
If you're not doing anything Friday night,
I thought we could go see a movie.

142
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,586
You know, I think I have the dinner shift
on Friday.

143
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,464
- Okay. What about Saturday?
- You know, I'm not sure.

144
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,634
The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?

145
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,802
- Great.
- Okay.

146
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,599
So you just let me know when you know.
Okay, so... Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

147
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,437
- What did I do wrong?
- Why are you asking me?

148
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,191
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny...

149
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,319
...nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

150
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,574
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: What does that mean?
- Nothing.

151
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,952
You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...

152
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,830
- ...where, obviously, none exists.
- No, I didn't.

153
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,250
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

154
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,131
- What's going on with you?
- Well, I might ask you the same question.

155
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,176
Why do you drag me into matters
which have nothing to do with me...

156
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:59,180
...but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

157
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,232
What's wrong with your face?

158
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,569
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

159
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,364
- Good day, Leonard.
- What?

160
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,825
I said, good day.

161
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,496
Good day?

162
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,542
Also today we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon...

163
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,919
...served with a teriyaki glaze
and sticky rice.

164
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,922
- Our soup of the day...
- You must release me from my oath.

165
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,595
Sheldon, I'm working.

166
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,764
Why don't you take a minute to decide?

167
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,392
I can't keep your secret, Penny.

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,105
I'm going to fold like an energy-based
de novo protein in conformational space.

169
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,483
Like a Renaissance triptych.

170
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,361
Like a cheap suit.

171
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,697
Look, why is it so hard
for you to keep one little secret?

172
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,407
I'm constitutionally incapable.

173
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,203
That's why I was refused clearance
for a government research fellowship...

174
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,873
...at a secret military supercollider
beneath a fake agricultural station...

175
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,335
...12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.

176
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,093
Which you did not hear about from me.

177
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,471
Look, just forget I told you about me...

178
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,765
...not graduating
from community college, okay?

179
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,936
Forget? You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

180
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,856
I haven't forgotten a thing since the day
my mother stopped breastfeeding me.

181
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,776
- It was a drizzly Tuesday.
- Okay.

182
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,238
You promised me
you would keep my secret...

183
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,116
...so you are just gonna have to
figure out a way to do it.

184
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,661
Leonard, I'm moving out.

185
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,999
What do you mean
you're moving out? Why?

186
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,627
There doesn't have to be a reason.

187
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,840
- Yeah, there kind of does.
- Not necessarily.

188
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,884
This is a classic example
of Münchausen's trilemma.

189
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,013
Either the reason is predicated on a series
of sub-reasons leading to regression...

190
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,809
...or it tracks back to axiomatic statements,
or it's ultimately circular...

191
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,146
...i. e., I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

192
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,441
I'm still confused.

193
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,694
Leonard, I don't see
how I could've made it any simpler.

194
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,364
Hey, qu'est-ce que c'up?

195
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,410
We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized cadavers.

196
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,705
Some of those skinless chicks were hot.

197
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,751
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.

198
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,839
That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.

199
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,177
It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.

200
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,304
What did you do?

201
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,849
Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the television?

202
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,642
- No.
- Did you take a Band-Aid off...

203
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,603
...in front of him?

204
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,688
- No.
- Did you buy generic ketchup?

205
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,317
Forget to rinse the sink?
Talk to him through the bathroom door?

206
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,405
Adjust the thermostat? Cook with cilantro?
Pronounce the T in "often"?

207
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,074
No.

208
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,703
Did you make fun of trains?

209
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,917
I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.

210
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,002
Well, we all knew this day was coming.

211
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,631
That was fast.

212
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,801
It's my pre-packed
disaster evacuation bag.

213
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,055
It's recommended by
the Department of Homeland Security.

214
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,224
And Sarah Connor.

215
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,726
Where are you gonna live?

216
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,063
Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.

217
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,314
Bye.

218
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,154
Well... But you can't stay with me.
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

219
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,617
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
an aspect of manushya yajna...

or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

221
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,461
I hate trains.

222
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,135
Don't be ridiculous. You love trains.

223
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,888
Yes, I do. Come on.

224
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,685
See you later, Leonard.

I didn't bring my Geiger counter.

Yeah, I had it on my bed,
and I didn't pack it.

- If you're not comfortable staying here...
- I'm kidding. I packed it.

234
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,190
It was a joke. Yeah, I was subverting
the conversational expectations.

Terrific.

- Yes. Isn't she an amazing actress?

she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

By comparison, Madhuri Dixit
is a leprous prostitute.
