1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,173
- I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.
- Ugh.

2
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:12,302
You're the doctor, but I'm constantly
hearing this annoying sound.

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,180
Me too.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,808
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,479
No, it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,441
Yeah, there's no inflammation at all,
Sheldon.

7
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,860
Then it must be a tumor.

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,779
I seriously doubt it.

9
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:35,492
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

10
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,372
Is that possible?
I used to get those all the time.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,791
Even in church.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:47,838
Well, you know, if it is from a swirly,
there's something I can do, okay. Ahem.

13
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,760
Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot.

14
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,721
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,182
- I'll be right in.
- Okay.

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,975
It's not enough she mocks me...

17
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,353
...but that isn't even the correct procedure
for a cootie shot.

18
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,192
Do you understand that Stephanie's
not here to treat your imaginary ailments?

19
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,487
How is it imaginary that
I keep hearing an octave above middle C?

20
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,113
<font color="#E86CE4">(HUMS)</font>

21
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,074
Is that imaginary?

22
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,450
<font color="#E86CE4">(HUMS)</font>

23
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,660
I don't think so.

24
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,412
<font color="#E86CE4">(HUMS)</font>

25
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,541
- Good night.
- Leonard, there's one more thing.

26
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,169
Article One, Section Three
of our roommate agreement.

27
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,755
- I'm calling an emergency meeting.
- No, you're not.

28
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,550
Leonard moves the meeting not occur.
Second? None heard, the motion fails.

29
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:38,055
I'd like to begin the meeting
by congratulating you on the progress...

30
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,224
...in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

31
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,559
- Thank you.
- And that being said...

32
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,146
...we have to discuss the implementation
of the cohabitation rider...

33
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,066
...which has been activated
now that you're living together.

34
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,820
- We're not living together.
- I beg to disagree. Ahem.

35
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,240
"A girlfriend shall be deemed, quote,
living with, unquote, Leonard...

36
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,992
...when she has stayed over,
A, 10 consecutive nights...

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,079
...or B, more than nine nights
in a three-week period, or C...

38
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,666
...all the weekends of a given month
plus three weeknights."

39
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,546
- That's absurd.
- No.

40
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,924
You initialed it. See? "L.H., L.H., L.H."

41
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,803
Okay, wait. I only initialed it
because I never thought it would happen.

42
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:24,101
I initialed another clause naming you
my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

43
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,770
Hm. Yes, you did.

44
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,858
Now to review, the following provisions
are hereby activated.

45
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,862
In the refrigerator, as opposed to two
separate shelves and one communal shelf...

46
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,657
...the three of us now get individual shelves
and the door becomes communal.

47
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,452
Next, apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week...

48
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,581
...to accommodate the increased
accumulation of dead skin cells.

49
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,083
The bathroom schedule.
I'm given to understand...

50
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,045
...women have different needs,
so we'll have to discuss that.

51
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,134
- I'm going to bed.
- But, yeah, but...

52
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,594
At least take this with you.

53
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,890
Look, and have Stephanie
initial here, here, here, here...

54
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,143
...and here.

55
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,978
This states that she does not now...

56
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,315
...nor does she intend to play a percussive
or brass instrument.

60
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,335
...pressing on the auditory nerve.

61
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,238
- No, absolutely not.
- It's not a big deal.

62
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,949
We have latex gloves.

63
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,742
I don't care what the symptoms are.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,120
My girlfriend is not gonna give you
a prostate exam.

65
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,042
- Hi, Sheldon.
- Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

66
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,503
I trust Leonard satisfied you
sexually last night?

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,964
Oh, good God.

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,050
Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

69
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,512
I heard you ask it over and over.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,348
How is it inappropriate for me
to ask it once?

71
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,893
- He did very nicely.
- But see? She's not offended.

72
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,853
And now you finally have an answer.

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,483
- Out of coffee. Need coffee.
- Uh...

74
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,903
- Hello.
- Hi. Stephanie, right?

75
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,406
Mm-hm. And...? And you are?

76
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,533
I'm Penny. I live across the hall.

77
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,828
- Heard a lot about you.
- Really?

78
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,123
- Mm-hm. Ha, ha.
- I haven't heard a thing about you.

79
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:03,635
Leonard? Why haven't I heard a thing about
this woman who lives across the hall...

80
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:08,432
...and comes into your apartment
in the morning in her underwear?

81
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,396
Um. Uh...

82
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,191
She's heard about you
because we're, you know, involved...

83
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,029
...and you haven't heard about her
because...

84
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,823
I never slept with her, I swear.

85
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:29,077
In Leonard's defense,
it wasn't for lack of trying.

86
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,290
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome, Leonard.

87
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,710
Look, I'm just saying, um...

88
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,213
...Penny is one of our many neighbors,
you know.

89
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,050
And in our building,
neighbors come and go.

90
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,802
Well, it's very casual. No dress code or...

91
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,431
Some mornings, I'll mosey down
to the third floor in my pajamas...

92
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,100
...and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

93
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:56,688
Really? I've never once been invited
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

94
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,315
She doesn't like you.

95
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,735
- Well, you have a gall bladder to remove.
- Yeah.

96
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,364
And I have to get in the shower
and Penny has clothes to put on, so...

97
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,077
- Well, it was very nice meeting you.
- Nice to finally meet you too.

98
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,954
- I'll see you tonight? Bye.
- Yeah. Bye-bye.

99
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,801
What could I possibly have done to offend
Mrs. Vartabedian?

100
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,846
So that's Stephanie, huh?

101
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,851
Why do I feel like I'm the one
that just got the prostate exam?

102
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,860
- You know, she seems very nice.
- Oh, she is. She's terrific.

103
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,238
And she's proving to be
a valuable roommate.

104
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,742
- Roommate? You guys are living together?
- Like hippies.

105
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,786
We're not living together.

106
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,414
Do I have to pull out
the paperwork again?

107
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,040
We're not living together.

108
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,127
- Are you sure?
- How could I not be sure?

109
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,587
Well, let's find out.

110
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,341
Don't you think if a woman was living
with me, I'd be the first one to know?

111
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,803
Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one
to know about it.

112
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,266
Hmm.

113
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,977
Cute dresses.

114
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,938
I bet this looks great on you.

115
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,315
We're not living together.

116
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,025
Okay. Hmm.

117
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,736
Scented candles, fuzzy slippers. Ooh.

118
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,239
Floral bed sheets.

119
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,199
We're not living together.

120
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,492
Okay, moving on.

121
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,412
Uh, who are these guys at Disney World?

122
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,621
Uh...

123
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,082
The big dog is Goofy.

124
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:44,087
And the older couple with the mouse ears,
I have no idea.

125
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,215
We're not living together.

126
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,843
You're gonna go down swinging, huh?

127
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,307
All right. Well, we got your body lotion,
your In Style magazine, your jewelry box.

128
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,519
We're not... Where's my Bat-Signal?

129
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,857
- You have a Bat-Signal?
- I did.

130
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,401
It was right here.

131
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,570
She must have...

132
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,823
Oh, my God, we're living together.

133
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,452
Really? What was your first clue?

134
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,801
New pants?

135
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,471
Yeah. Stephanie got them for me.

136
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,848
Nice. Cotton?

137
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,810
Actually, I think
it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.

138
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,606
The girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh?
Sounds serious.

139
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,568
It is, actually.
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought...

140
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,571
...and I decided it was time
for us to live together.

141
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,742
Oh, Leonard, huge mistake.

142
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,788
There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner...

143
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,208
...eating the same deviled egg,
over and over again.

144
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,504
At least I have an egg.
What do you have?

145
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,967
A veritable smorgasbord
of potential sexual partners.

146
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,344
See the blond over there?

147
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,223
I can hit on her and you can't.

148
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,518
So go hit on her.

149
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,440
She's not my type.

150
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,318
Too bad.
She was checking you out before.

151
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,154
- She was?
- Of course not. Look at her.

152
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,367
You know, I don't care
what you guys think.

153
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,036
Stephanie and I are very happy
living together.

154
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,540
I will give either of you $20 right now
to trade pants with me.

155
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,009
- Sheldon? What are you doing here?
- Hang on.

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,388
130/80. That's a little high.

157
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,642
We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

158
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,604
Where did you get the stethoscope
and pressure cuff?

159
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,523
My Aunt Marion gave them to me
for my 12th birthday.

160
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,404
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

161
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,200
And by the way, the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer.

162
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,787
- Thank you.
- Didn't teach you that in medical school?

163
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,166
- I'm kind of busy here.
- I understand.

164
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,127
All I need is for you to authorize
these tests.

165
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,590
Ha. A cardiac stress test,
a full-body MRI, an electromyogram...

166
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,884
...a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?

167
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,220
Oh, and exploratory laparoscopy.
The last time I had hiccups...

168
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,307
...it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions.

169
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,976
Go home, Sheldon.

170
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,936
Can I at least have the upper GI?

171
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,106
I already drank the barium.

172
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,568
Oh, hey.

173
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,695
Oh, good.
Do you have any fabric softener?

174
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,572
Yeah, sure.

175
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,459
What, are you washing a crocodile?

176
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,462
No. The pants that Stephanie got me.

177
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,132
Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these.
They'll be ruined.

178
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,967
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

179
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,599
Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

180
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,979
- Are you guys having problems?
- No. Everything's fine.

181
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,233
- Really?
- Yeah, it's wonderful.

182
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,488
Okay, maybe this whole
living together happened...

183
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,782
...kind of suddenly,
but it's fine, it's great.

184
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,244
Okay, Leonard, if you're uncomfortable
with the way things are going...

185
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,413
...you're allowed to say something.

186
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,957
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

187
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,335
Believe me, your feelings
are just as important as hers.

188
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,464
No, that doesn't sound right either.

189
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,636
Tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace you both are comfortable with.

190
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,849
Yeah, I could say something
like that to her.

191
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,143
I'll go do that.

192
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,687
- Thank you.
- Sure.

193
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,236
You have a really good grasp on this.

194
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,405
Maybe you could talk to her?

195
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,158
You're kidding, right?

196
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,035
No, but that's okay.

197
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,540
I'll go talk to her.

198
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,668
Wanna come with?

199
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,422
Go.

200
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,717
Wow.

201
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,226
Oh, no.

202
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,437
What?

203
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,565
You were right.
Your larynx is terribly inflamed.

204
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,611
- I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
- I knew it.

205
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,406
What do I do?

206
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,452
You're gonna need to stop talking,
immediately.

207
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,371
- For how long should...?
- Eh, eh, eh!

208
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,249
Immediately.

209
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,920
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, honey.

210
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,755
Sheldon.

211
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,472
What's going on?

212
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,226
I just performed a Sheldon-ectomy.

213
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,021
Careful. If you don't get it all,
it'll only come back worse.

215
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,942
- Gotcha.
- Listen, we need to talk.

216
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,027
Uh-oh.

217
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,905
Do we need to talk,
or do we need to talk.

218
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,574
I don't know what that means.

219
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,203
Okay, why don't you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me?

220
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,871
Okay. Um...

221
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,624
Well, look, it's just that...

222
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,670
...things between you and me
have been going pretty quick.

223
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,298
- And?
- It's just a little scary.

224
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,218
Well, yeah, but scary good, right?

225
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,387
Sure.

226
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,558
When is scary not good?

227
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:17,105
- But... Okay. Um, I have feelings, right?
- Uh-huh.

228
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,316
Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express
those feelings, right?

229
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,944
Of course. Why don't you tell me
what you're feeling?

230
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,948
Okay, well, I ju... I think it's important
to remember that we move...

231
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:32,078
...at a pace that is our speed and...

232
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,540
Oh, shoot, I had it.

233
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,502
Okay, how about this?
How about I tell you what I'm feeling?

234
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,588
What's that?

235
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,925
Really? Right now?

236
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,595
- Why not?
- I just ate.

237
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,805
Aren't you supposed to wait an hour?

238
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,518
I think that's for swimming.

239
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,813
- Ah. Okay.
- Okay.

240
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,150
- Hope I don't get cramps.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,945
- Hey.
- Hey.

242
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,364
- Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
- Thank you.

243
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,825
- Your pants are ruined.
- Good.

244
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,871
So how did the talk with Stephanie go?

245
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,209
Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

246
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,379
So you told her you wanted
to slow things down?

247
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,967
Not specifically.
But, um, I did tell her that I had feelings.

248
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,303
Good. Good.

249
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,930
And then what?

250
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:37,435
And then the subject
got changed somehow.

251
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,521
You had sex, didn't you?

252
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,190
Um...

253
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,900
Little bit.

254
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,530
- What?
- Nothing.

255
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,245
Okay, well, it sounds like
things are gonna work out.

256
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,206
Yeah. Yeah, it's all good.

257
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,334
Everything's gonna work out,
one way or another.

258
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,503
God, come on, Leonard.

259
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,090
You are entitled to try and make things
go the way you want them to.

260
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,550
- Really?
- Yes.

261
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,261
You don't always have to go along
with what the woman wants.

262
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,180
Huh.

263
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:20,144
- What?
- Nothing. Just rethinking my whole life.

264
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,485
Okay, here's the thing.

265
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,406
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out,
she'll just dump me.

266
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,825
Well, that's a chance you have to take.

267
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,411
I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

268
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,664
Very comforting.

269
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,127
Okay, so, what do I say to her?

270
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,754
I don't know.
What have women said to you...

271
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,590
...when they wanted
to slow a relationship down?

272
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,219
I really like you,
but I wanna see how things go with Mark?

273
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,266
Yeah, that'll slow it down.

00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,112

So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

279
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,207
- I really like you...
- Oh, God, here comes the speech.

280
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,837
What speech?

281
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:33,259
I really like you but maybe we should spend
a little less time together...

282
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,846
...because I need my space,
but I'll call you on Tuesday.

283
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,475
And then you never call me, so I call you,
but you don't call me back.

284
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,935
And then when I run into you
at the coffee shop...

285
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,480
...you pretend you have problems
with voice mail...

286
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,108
...and I know that you're lying
but I pretend like I don't care...

287
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,070
...even though I'm dying inside.

288
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,159
No.

289
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,122
No, no. Uh,
I wasn't gonna say any of that.

290
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,374
I was just gonna say...

291
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,837
- ...I really like you.
- Oh!

292
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,259
Oh, good, because I really like you too.

293
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,265
Terrific.

294
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,564

- Hey.

297
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,240
Yeah. Stephanie got it for me.
It's kind of fun.

298
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,118
It's got a big bird on it, dude.

299
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,955
Yeah, yeah. That's the fun part.

300
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,668
We're also getting new curtains for my
bedroom and a dust ruffle and a duvet.

301
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,839
And I don't even know what a duvet is,
but I'm sure if I did I wouldn't want one.

302
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:57,301
But every time I talk to her about
moving out, she cries and we have sex.

303
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,472
You're lucky.
With me, it's usually the other way around.

304
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,726
You know, if you can't talk to her,
why don't you just text her?

305
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,939
- Isn't that kind of cowardly?
- Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

306
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,193
That's true. But, on the other hand,
you are wearing a bird sweater.

307
