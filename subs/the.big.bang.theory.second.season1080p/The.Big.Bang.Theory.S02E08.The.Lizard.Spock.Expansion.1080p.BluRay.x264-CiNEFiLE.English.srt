Oh, look. Saturn 3 is on.

00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,464
I don't wanna watch Saturn 3.
Deep Space Nine is better.

00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,509
How is Deep Space Nine
better than Saturn 3?

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,263
Simple subtraction
will tell you it's six better.

00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,975
Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.

Well, five is partway between three...
Never mind.

00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,403
I'll tell you what.
How about we go Rock, Paper, Scissors?

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,030
Ooh, I don't think so.

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,450
Anecdotal evidence suggests
that in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors...

12
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,120
...players familiar with each other will tie
75 to 80 percent of the time...

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,289
...due to the limited number of outcomes.

14
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:44,626
I suggest
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,088
- What?
- It's very simple.

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,674
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock...

17
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,427
...rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock...

18
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,221
...Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard...

19
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,640
...lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock...

20
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:03,604
...Spock vaporizes rock,
and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

21
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,275
Okay, I think I got it.

22
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,988
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

23
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,531
Oh...

24
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,664
Hello, boys.

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,501
Ahoy, matey.

26
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,503
Noticed the eye patch, did you?

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,173
It's all part of a technique
I've been studying for picking up women.

28
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,217
You employ a visual display...

29
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:38,097
...designed to make yourself
distinctive and memorable.

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,974
Oh, yes, like the male peacock
with brilliant plumage...

31
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,353
...or the rutting baboon
with engorged hindquarters.

32
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,190
Or in this case,
the bar mitzvah boy with pink eye.

33
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,068
Mock me if you will, but it works.

34
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,070
You show up in something distinctive...

35
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,447
...scope out your target
and toss out some negs.

36
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,283
- What are negs?
- A neg is a negative compliment...

37
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,036
...that throws a pretty woman
off her game, like:

38
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,624
"Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth,
but on you they work."

39
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,545
I got a whole list of them.
Who wants to be my wingman?

40
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,215
You're not gonna need a wingman.
You're gonna need a paramedic.

He says he's in trouble. DEFCON 5.

DEFCON 5? Well, there's no need to rush.

Well, Star Trek V, worse than 1.

70
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,218
First of all, that's a comparison of quality,
not intensity.

71
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:26,098
Secondly, Star Trek I is orders of
magnitude worse than Star Trek V.

Are you joking?

73

No, no, no.

75
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,232
Star Trek V has specific failures
in writing and direction...

...while Star Trek I fails across the board.

- Just say, "Leonard went to the office."

somebody fun like you.

325
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,705
Leonard, Stephanie, you're alive.
It's a miracle.

326
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,877
So anyway, Lisa,
I just wanted to tell you again...

327
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:54,966
...how much I enjoyed the other night,
and again, I'm sorry for how it ended.

328
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,011
But again,
if you could let me know about Friday...

329
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,723
...my mother needs a head count
so she can know how big a brisket to get.

330
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,142
Howard. Look at this.

332
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,646
Anyway, call me. It's Howard.

00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,025
<font color="#808080">ANNOUNCER</font> <font color="#E86CE4">(ON TV)</font>: It's unclear how
the Mars rover got into the crevice...

334
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,652
...but one thing's certain:

335
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,573
The data which it has sent back
contain the first clear indications...

336
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,034
...that there may have been life on Mars.

337
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,829
It's a scientific discovery...

338
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,832
...that has staggering implications
for all mankind.

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,211
Unfortunately,
we'll never know who's responsible.
