1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,962
So if you are considering
going into experimental physics...

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,922
...my door is always open.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,925
Again, I'm sorry that the demonstration
didn't quite work out.

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,385
Now we know what happens...

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,889
...when you accidentally spill peach
Snapple into a helium-neon laser.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,768
The short answer is don't.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,859
Now to tell you about
the Theoretical Physics Department...

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,527
...is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,284
- Dr. Cooper?
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Forget it.

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,704
Excuse me.

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,207
- Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: It's a waste of time.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,753
I might as well explain thermodynamics
to a bunch of Labradoodles.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,259
If you don't do this,
I won't take you to the comic-book store.

14
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,221
Hello.

15
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,812
Nice work with the laser, by the way.

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,150
Looking out at your fresh young faces...

17
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,612
...I remember when I too
was deciding my academic future...

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,573
...as a lowly graduate student.

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,034
Of course, I was 14...

20
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,995
...and had achieved more
than you could ever hope to...

21
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,414
...despite my 9:00 bedtime.

22
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,753
Now, there may be one or two of you
in this room who has what it takes...

23
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,047
...to succeed in theoretical physics.

24
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,675
It's more likely that you will spend
your careers teaching fifth graders...

25
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,304
...how to make papier-mâché volcanoes
with baking-soda lava.

26
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,349
Oh, good God.

27
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,644
In short, anyone who told you
that you would someday be able...

28
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,189
...to make any significant contribution
to physics played a trick on you.

29
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,108
A cruel trick indeed.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,028
Any questions?

31
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,242
Of course not.

32
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,161
I weep for the future of science.

33
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,331
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the latest issue of Batman is out.

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,875
Come, Leonard.

35
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,215
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

36
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,200
I love this time of the year.

37
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,287
The leaves are turning.
There's a bracing chill in the air.

38
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,081
Plus, there's a whole new crop
of female grad students...

39
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,169
...about to put on just enough winter
weight to make them needy and vulnerable.

40
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,133
That's right, honey, have another calzone.
Daddy can wait.

41
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,513
Isn't there a policy
against dating graduate students?

42
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,016
No. If you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

43
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,684
Damn. There's always a catch.

44
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,979
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.

45
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,441
So, dumb-ass, I heard you made
a grad student throw up last night.

46
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:18,113
The truth can indeed be a finger down
the throat of those unprepared to hear it.

47
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,991
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

48
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,703
Because first-rate minds
call you "dumb-ass."

49
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,457
Oh, yeah? Well...

50
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,542
You're a mean person.

51
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,086
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper?

52
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,923
I'm Ramona Nowitzki.
I was at your talk last night.

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,427
- I think you're just brilliant.
- Well, that is the prevailing opinion.

54
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,180
God, now I'm gonna throw up.

55
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,266
Howard Wolowitz,
Department of Engineering...

56
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,979
...co-designer of the International Space
Station's liquid-waste-disposal system.

57
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,067
Ew.

58
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,322
Dr. Cooper, I've read everything
you've published.

59
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,909
I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates...

60
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,162
...and was wondering how you determined
that three-dimensional string nets...

61
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,623
...provided a unified picture of fermions
and gauge bosons.

62
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,710
Amazing. An intelligent Labradoodle.

63
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,004
Woof.

64
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,175
The fact is,
I'm quite close to a breakthrough...

65
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,303
...in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

66
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,932
Oh, my God. That would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,976
It's what I do.

68
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,729
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
liquid-waste-disposal system...

69
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,524
...is turning a few heads as well.

70
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,530
Again, ew.

71
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,576
You know, I'd love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos.

72
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,289
- Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
- I don't drink coffee.

73
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,416
I do. I love me a cup of Joe.

74
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,210
It doesn't have to be coffee.
How about dinner?

75
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,463
- I do eat dinner.
- Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.

76
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,718
I never eat in strange restaurants.
One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.

77
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:08,765
- Excuse me?
- Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.

78
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,102
Three tines is not a fork.
Three tines is a trident.

79
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,440
Forks are for eating,
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

80
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,236
- What if I brought food to your place?
- That would be acceptable.

81
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,863
On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

82
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,658
Mee Krob and chicken satay
with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.

83
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,828
You got it. I already have your address.

84
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,250
What a nice girl.

85
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,712
Sheldon, do you have any idea
what just happened?

86
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,257
Yes. Apparently, I'm getting a free dinner.

87
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,307
Oh, yeah, no,
this thing's majorly out of order.

88
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,935
- See? I'm sorry.
- Okay. Guess I'm taking the stairs.

89
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,604
- Where you going?
- Four-A.

90
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,107
- Oh, are you here to see Leonard?
- No, Dr. Cooper.

91
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,943
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

92
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,446
We're having dinner.

93
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,032
Sheldon Cooper?

94
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:12,788
Tall, thin, looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

95
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,750
He is cute, isn't he?

96
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,463
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>:
Sheldon Cooper?

97
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,426
- Hi, Leonard.
- Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

98
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,053
Thanks. Where should I put this?

99
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,846
- The kitchen's fine.
- Okay.

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,265
- Hey. What are you doing?
- I need to see this.

101
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,767
Uh-huh.

102
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,562
The viewing area's right over there.

103
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,151
Sheldon, your girl... Date... Person...
Ramona's here.

104
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,780
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, sorry I'm late.

105
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,491
I got caught up reading the draft
of your latest paper.

106
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,328
Did you enjoy the footnote where
I illustrate mirror symmetry by likening it...

107
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,831
- ...to The Flash playing tennis with himself?
- So funny.

108
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,332
<font color="#E86CE4">(LAUGHS)</font>

109
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,585
The idea that you might be able
to incorporate gravity...

110
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,714
...I have to tell you,
I found it physically exhilarating.

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,760
My hypotheses tend to have that effect.

112
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,140
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough
for your friends.

113
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,684
I assumed we were going to be alone.

114
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,022
Oh. Yeah. No, we were just going.

115
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,649
To watch, right?

116
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,864
- No. Come on now. We're going out.
- Oh, come on. We'll be quiet.

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,407
Come on, let's go.

118
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,243
Okay, you two.

119
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:38,248
You just have a nice whatever this is.

120
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,964
Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none
of my business, but I just... I have to ask.

121
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,883
What's Sheldon's deal?

122
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,556
- What do you mean, "deal"?
- You know, like, what's his deal?

123
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,893
Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?

124
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:03,106
Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption that he has no deal.

125
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,942
- Oh, come on, everybody has a deal.
- Not Sheldon.

126
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,655
Over the years, we've formulated many
theories about how he might reproduce.

127
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,743
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

128
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,037
I'm sorry?

129
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,457
I believe, one day, Sheldon will eat
an enormous amount of Thai food...

130
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,668
...and split into two Sheldons.

131
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,548
On the other hand, I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species.

132
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,967
He'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later...

133
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,595
...with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

134
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,766
Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.

135
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,104
- Hey, do you wanna hang out with us?
- Well, what are you guys gonna do?

136
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,565
Uh...

137
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,401
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

138
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,322
- The one with the little onions?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,621
Yeah, I'm busy. So good night.

140
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,041
Her loss. Let's go.

141
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,795
Brisket party. B to the R to the I-S-K.

142
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,215
To the E to the T to the...

143
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,677
- Ooh...
- Don't.

144
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,768
- Hey. Aren't you having breakfast?
- Yes.

145
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,398
Are you experimenting
with nutritional suppositories again?

146
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,985
Not in these pants.

147
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:35,323
- So how'd it go with Ramona last night?
- Oh, great.

148
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,492
She's smart, insightful.

149
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,663
She has a very unique way of,
you know, revering me.

150
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:48,420
- Here's your spinach-mushroom omelet.
- Thank you.

151
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,007
- Did anyone touch it?
- Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

152
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,383
I was vigilant.

153
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,178
Ramona pointed out
that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day...

154
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,805
...standing on cafeteria lines.

155
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,726
Time which would be better spent tackling
the great physics problems of our day.

156
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:07,397
You don't tackle the big issues, Ramona.
You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.

157
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,857
<font color="#E86CE4">(LAUGH ING)</font>

158
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,903
Touché.

159
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,698
- Morning.
- Oh, hey, Leslie.

160
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,867
So I see you're organizing your papers...

161
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,329
...for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumb-Assery.

162
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:27,709
There won't be any room until they get rid
of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

163
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,754
Oh, good one.

164
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,965
I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles.

165
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,843
I'll let you keep your lunch money today.

166
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,763
Okay, Dr. Cooper
is on the verge of a breakthrough.

167
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,516
If you're going to stay,
you'll have to be respectful and quiet.

168
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,526
Wait for me.

169
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,948
So have you worked out
the neutrino issue?

170
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,911
Well, to paraphrase Mozart,
all the subatomic particles are there.

171
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,122
- I just have to put them in the right order.
- You're so witty.

172
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,041
Aren't I?

174
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,090
Hey, guys, this package came for...

175
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,430
- Dr. Cooper is working.
- Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough.

176
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,599
Oh! Tickles.

177
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,019
Sorry.

178
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,984
Holy crap on a cracker.

179
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,447
- Hey, Penny.
- Hi. You probably don't wanna go in there.

180
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,824
Why? What are they doing?

181
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:46,871
You know, the only way I could explain it
would be in a therapist's office with dolls.

182
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,298
Ooh, boy.

183
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,470
- Dr. Cooper's working.
- Yeah, I can see that.

184
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,473
Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's.
You coming?

185
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:09,644
Oh, yes, it's Halo night.
Let me just dry my tootsies.

186
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,690
- You're not going to Halo night.
- Yes, I am. It's Wednesday.

187
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,192
Wednesday's Halo night.

188
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,612
Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less...

189
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,324
...than the fervent and unconditional
dedication of our entire lives"?

190
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,703
- He did.
- And who was that great man?

191
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,330
Me.

192
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,626
- Sorry, Leonard.
- Seriously? You're not coming?

193
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,838
You heard her. How can I argue with me?

194
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,801
Okay. Well, once again,
you guys have a good...

195
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,928
...whatever this is.

196
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,893
Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you,
your friends are holding you back.

197
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,313
I prefer to think of it as
I'm pulling them forward.

198
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,648
Halo night?

199
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,693
A man with your intellectual gifts
doesn't waste an evening...

200
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,986
...playing video games.

201
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,489
He does on Wednesdays.

202
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,866
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

203
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,702
He does want that.

204
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,416
Does a man with my intellectual gifts
play paintball on weekends?

205
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,503
- What do you think?
- Drat.

206
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,925
- Now, shall we get back to work?
- I suppose.

207
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,805
Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.

208
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,849
I guess I can wait for the DVD.

209
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,187
And then never, ever watch it.

210
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,416
Penny. Penny. Penny.

211
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,043
Sheldon, honey, I've told you,
it's a small apartment.

212
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,880
- You only have to knock one...
- I don't have a lot of time.

213
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:46,676
Look, Ramona finally dozed off,
and I need you to help me get rid of her.

214
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,763
Get rid of her how?

215
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,601
I don't know, but, apparently,
I'm in some kind of relationship...

216
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,021
...and, well, you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

217
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,109
Excuse me?

218
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,696
I see man after man
leaving this apartment never to return.

219
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,450
Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.

220
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,994
<font color="#808080">RAMONA</font>: Dr. Cooper?
- Hide me.

221
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,123
- Hide you?
- I formally request sanctuary.

222
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,001
Why aren't you working?

223
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,669
Um...

224
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,505
She distracted me.

225
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,508
I told you,
I don't have time for your nonsense.

226
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,345
I have important things to do.

227
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,224
- Oh, man.
- I know what's going on here.

228
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,394
Really?
Well, then will you explain it to me?

229
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,647
You're in love with Dr. Cooper.

230
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,400
Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.

231
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,611
Don't try to deny it.

232
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,198
He's a remarkable man,
but you have to let him go.

233
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,326
Oh, gee. Okay.

234
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:58,206
I know it's hard, but he's a gift
to the whole world, and we can't be selfish.

235
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,875
Yeah, he's a gift, all right.

236
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,836
Sisters?

237
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,217
Sure, sisters. Heh, heh.

238
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,552
Okay.

239
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,516
Holy crap on a cracker.

- What are you doing?
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: It's Morse code.

243
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,582
- Why?
- So we can communicate through the wall.

244
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,086
We are communicating through the wall.

245
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,589
Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

246
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,218
- I don't know Morse code.
- Oh, it's very simple. This is A.

This is B.

...at 3:00 in the morning.

00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,685
All right.

Don't come in here. Don't...

Oh.

- What's going on?
- Shh. Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

255
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,826
- I know. When is she going home?
- Never. That's the problem.

- I need your help.
- What are you talking about?

257
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,833
I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

258
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,544
That only applies
if you need me to help you destroy...

...an artificial intelligence you created
that's taking over the earth.

Come on, don't nitpick.

- Good night.
- All right.

262
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,850
I'm invoking our Body Snatchers clause.

263
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,395
The Body Snatchers clause requires me
to help destroy someone we know...

264
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,481
...who's been replaced with an alien pod.

265

Yes. She's in the living room.
Go. I'll wait here.

- Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
- Now. Do it.

<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I've got it!

272
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,467
I finally reconciled
the black hole information paradox...

273
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,303
...with my theory
of string-network condensates.

274
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,058
- It's unbelievable. It's paradigm-altering.
- And I could not have done it without you.

275
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,686
- I just offered a little encouragement.
- You did a lot more than that.

276
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,314
You helped me work out
the masses of the fermions...

277
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,066
...and you pumiced my hammertoe.

278
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,402
How can I ever repay you?

279
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,989
Well, would you consider naming it
the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

280
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,991
Who's Nowitzki?

281
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,830
- I'm Nowitzki.
- Oh, you want me to share credit?

282
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,373
Uh-huh.

Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.
I'm Kathy O'Brian.

...reconciling
the black hole information paradox...

289
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,023
...with your theory of string-network
condensates, and it took my breath away.

290
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,903
Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

291
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,826
Would you possibly have any time
for me to pick your brain?

292
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,870
Let's see. Today's Thursday.

293
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,955
Thursday nights
I eat pizza from Giacomo's.

294
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,959
- Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.
- Great. I'll bring it to your place.

295
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,419
I have the address.

296
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,465

00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,265
Yes. I'm getting a free pizza.

- More pad thai, please.
- Sheldon, you've already had four servings.

301
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,989
You might wanna
slow down a bit, buddy.

302
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,992
Just one more bite.
