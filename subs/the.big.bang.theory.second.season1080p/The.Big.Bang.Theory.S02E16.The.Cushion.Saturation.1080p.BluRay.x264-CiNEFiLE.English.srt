controls that.

We hide in the parking lot

to the second party...

00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:25,689
No, no, no, you had your chance to be "we"
for like a year and a half now.

169
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,443
Right now, you are you,
and you are screwed.

170
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,199
- Why do we have to tell him I did it?
- Not gonna tell him I did it.

171
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,118
Okay, okay, how about this?

172
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,622
We tell him somebody broke in.

173
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,003
Just to shoot the couch
with a paintball gun?

174
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,047
I'm sorry, I buy it.
All those people are on drugs.

175
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,885
We could tell him they wanted the couch
to stay away from their boyfriend.

176
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,974
Okay, fine.
Well, what if we just flip it over?

177
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,269
There. Looks fine, right?

178
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:09,107
Butt print.
There's no discernible butt print.

179
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,444
Oh, come on.

180
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,780
There. Butt print.

181
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,367
It's too small and too perfect.

182
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,455
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

183
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,790
Shh. Act normal.

184
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,001
Sheldon!

185
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,006
- How was the comic-book store?
- Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.

186
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,549
Great, great.

187
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,344
Did you walk the whole way?
It's a little chilly.

188
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,597
- Koothrappali picked me up.
- Isn't that terrific?

189
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,390
He is such a good friend.

190
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,101
You know what the best thing
about friends is?

191
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,688
They don't talk incessantly
for no particular reason?

192
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,025
No, no, friends forgive the little things.

193
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,944
- I'm gonna go home and wash my hair.
- Don't you dare, missy.

194
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,825
Hello, fastest man alive.

195
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,412
Wanna see me
read your entire comic book?

196
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,748
Wanna see it again?

197
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,144
Something's wrong.

198
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,440
- What do you mean?
- I'm not sure.

199
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,993
It doesn't feel right.

200
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,256
Oh, that. Penny did that.

Why don't you just eat
in your desk chair?

207
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,803
Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?

208
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,847
Here we go.

209
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,850
That is my desk chair.
That is where I work.

210
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,645
I don't eat in my desk chair
and I don't work in my spot.

211
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,357
I work in my desk chair
and eat in my spot.

212
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,234
Whackadoodle.

213
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,697
You know, there's kind of
an obvious solution here. Get up.

214
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,703
There, problem solved.

215
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,873
Nobody cares where you're gonna sit.

216
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,416
You're not crazy.

217
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,922
Excuse me,
but the problem is not solved.

218
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,800
If your head
had been accidentally amputated...

219
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,302
...and we transplanted a dog's head
in its place...

220
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,221
...would that be "problem solved"?

221
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,389
If it were your head, it would be.

222
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,727
Sheldon, I am really, really sorry,
but it's only for a week.

223
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,562
Can't you be a little bit flexible?

224
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,361
Yeah, sorry,
I didn't really think that through.

225
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,572
You claim it's going to be a week.
I have no faith in your cleaner.

226
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,325
- Why not?
- Did you notice the sign on his counter?

227
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,828
He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

228
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,372
He also makes keys.

229
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,415
Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.

230
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,875
Focus is important.

231
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,504
Was Michael DeBakey a wedding
planner in between heart transplants?

232
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,048
Did Alexander Fleming
moonlight as a hair dresser?

233
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,302
Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?

Gentlemen, adieu.

241
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,746
I thought we were gonna play
"Halo" tonight.

00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,123
What am I supposed to do?

243
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,001
There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

244
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,420
You understand, right?

245
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,009
No, not at all.

246
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,052
Nevertheless, I must depart.

247
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,348
By the way, did I tell you Leslie pulled
strings and got me on the trip to Geneva...

248
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,475
...to check out the CERN super collider?

249
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,936
That's not fair.
You're not even a physicist.

250
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,980
There are two ways
of looking at this...

251
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,190
- Get out.
- Bye.

252
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,571
You're improving.

253
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,990
Thank you.

254
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,577
It helps when I get to practice
with a real woman.

255
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,789
Hey, listen.
Saturday, my sister's getting married.

256
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,959
I want you to come with me.
It's black tie.

257
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,005
Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.

258
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,214
Why not?

259
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:29,594
When I go to weddings
it's to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

260
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,305
I don't know
what I would do with a date.

261
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,432
Oh, all right.

262
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,142
I understand.

263
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,977
Thanks.

264
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,023
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

265
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,609
- What about it?
- Oh, didn't you hear?

266
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,446
I had to reduce the number of people going
and you didn't make the cut.

267
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,490
When did that happen?

268
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,951
About 12 seconds ago.

269
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:59,874
Hold on. Are you saying if I don't go
to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?

270
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,710
Well, actually, I'm trying not to say it.

271
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,589
Okay, I'm sorry,
but that makes me a little uncomfortable.

272
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,175
- How so?
- Because it's like you're controlling me...

273
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,053
...with new equipment
and research trips.

274
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,099
If I weren't controlling you with equipment
and trips, I'd be uncomfortable.

275
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,851
- How so?
- Because we'd be in a real relationship...

276
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,312
...with feelings and all that crap.

277
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:29,570
So bottom line,
I'm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

278
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,490
No.

279

299
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,293
Nope.

300
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,172
What do you mean "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

301
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,133
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

- Penny, Penny.

305
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,893
More?

306
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,394
I'm afraid so.

307
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,022
You know the cashew chicken
I get you on Monday nights?

308
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,857
Yes, from Szechwan Palace.

309
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,736
Szechwan Palace closed two years ago.

310
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,865
What?

311
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,702
- Where did my cashew chicken come from?
- Golden Dragon.

312
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,751
No.

313
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,713
No, this isn't right.

No, our food always comes
in Szechwan Palace containers.

315
00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:01,180
Yeah, well, before they went out of
business, I bought 4000 containers.

316
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,017
I keep them in the trunk of my car.

317
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,395
But...

318
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,940
Oh, this changes everything.

his mind off the cushion.

How can I know?

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,536
- You did make that up, right?
- Oh, God, I wish I had.

- Leonard?
- Yeah, buddy?

323
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,083
I still don't like this cushion.

324
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,381
Okay, first of all...

00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,718
- ...Penny, thank you for coming.
- Oh, thanks for the shoes.

Penny is an amazing shot. I think
we have a chance to win this week.

327
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,016
- What's the plan?
- Okay. Now, we all run out...

328
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,935
...Sheldon and I will cut to the left
behind these trees.

00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,063

flank to the right behind the rocks.

330
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,734
We'll all have a great view as Penny
runs out and kills everyone in sight.

331
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,737
All right, just one thing before we start.

332
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,488
What is it, Sheldon?

333
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,656
Oh!

334
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,659
What the hell?

335
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,787
That was for my cushion.

336
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,373
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:14,629
I'm sorry, Leonard.

338
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,715
Screw that.

339
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,802
She can't shoot me. She's dead.

340
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,722
He's right. You can't.

341
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,065
Well, if we're going to descend
into anarchy...

342
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,446
Okay. See you.

343
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,157
Where are you going?

344
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,785
Surrender, then Denny's.
