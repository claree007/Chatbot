1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,087
Mm.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,799
Gentlemen, I put it to you:

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,259
The worst tapioca pudding...

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:14,263
...is better than the best pudding
of any other flavor.

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,934
First off, that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,356
Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,986
- It is extracted from the plant...
- Hey, I'm thinking of growing a mustache.

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,238
Oh, no kidding.

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,033
- A Fu Manchu, a handlebar, pencil?
- It's extracted from...

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,077
I'm not sure yet.
You know, George Clooney has one now.

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,413
Really? I once saw him
shopping at Ralphs.

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,914
He was buying tequila.

13
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:45,627
Wow, you'd think a guy like that
would have some kind of booze lackey.

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,716
All right, this is cruel.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,510
We better let him finish
before his head explodes.

16
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,512
All right. Sheldon, why is tapioca...?

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,265
Tapioca is extracted
from the root of Manihot esculenta.

18
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,309
Due to a high concentration of cyanide...

19
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,687
...it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly.

20
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,775
Feel better now?

21
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,487
It's indigenous to Brazil, as is the cocoa
bean from which we get chocolate.

22
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,073
You promised
you wouldn't do that anymore.

23
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,577
- Hey, Hofstadter.
- Hey, Kripke.

24
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,871
Heard about your anti-proton
decay experiment.

25
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,208
Twenty thousand data runs
and no statistically significant results.

26
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,543
Very impressive.

27
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,713
What a jerk.

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,175
Don't feel bad, Leonard.
Negative results are still results.

29
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,220
- Even 20,000 of them.
- All right.

30
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,431
Please don't cheer me up anymore.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,892
Come on, don't let him get to you.
It's Kripke.

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,561
Yeah, he's a ginormous knob.

33
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,857
That's why he eats by himself
instead of sitting here at the cool table.

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,443
For shizzle.

35
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,617
Hey, it's true, Kripke lacks the basic
social skills that we take for granted.

36
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,204
But he controls
the new Open Science Grid computer...

37
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,208
...that I need to run simulations
of structure formation in the early universe.

38
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,087
Good luck getting time on it. The only
people he lets use it are his friends.

39
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,381
Well, then, the solution is simple.

40
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,508
I shall befriend him.

41
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,260
Kripke.

42
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,387
Yeah?

43
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,765
What would you say to the idea
of you and I becoming friends?

44
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,308
I would say...

45
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,395
...I have no interest
in becoming your friend.

46
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,065
Really?
Oh, that seems rather shortsighted...

47
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,360
...coming from someone
who is considered altogether unlikable.

48
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,989
Take some time to reconsider.

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,198
Yeah, I'll do that.

50
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,162
Well, I think we're off to a terrific start.

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,773
There you go.
Now any e-mail from Wolowitz...

52
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,234
...will go right into your spam folder.

53
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,778
Thanks. The e-mail doesn't bother me...

54
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,115
...as much as the vacation pictures
of him in a bathing suit.

55
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,492
Yeah, I got the same one.

56
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,163
And that's not a bathing suit,
it's a tan line.

57
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,629
Hello, this is Sheldon Cooper.

58
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,132
I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke.

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,720
Barry, it was pleasant seeing you today
in the cafeteria.

60
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,848
I saw that you purchased
the chef's salad.

61
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,476
Apparently, you did not know
that the chef's salad...

62
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,938
...is kitchen trickery
to utilize scrap meat.

63
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,983
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it.

64
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,486
I'm following up
on our pending friendship.

65
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,949
And I look forward
to hearing from you regarding its status.

66
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,534
Sheldon Cooper.

67
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,872
What's up with Ichabod?

68
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,375
Oh, he's trying to make a new friend.

69
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,335
Oh, really? Well, good for him.

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,712
Unless he makes one out of wood
like Geppetto...

71
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,589
...I don't think it's gonna happen.

72
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,051
Well, how did you guys become friends?

73
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,221
There was a flyer on the bulletin board
at the university:

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,183
"Roommate wanted.
Whistlers need not apply."

75
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,851
And you moved in anyway?

76
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,687
I assumed he was joking.

77
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:36,233
You'd be surprised how many
particle physicists have a whimsical side.

78
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,444
What about Howard and Raj?
How did he become friends with them?

79
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,447
I don't know. How do carbon atoms
form a benzene ring?

80
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,866
Proximity and valence electrons.

81
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,037
Well, yeah, sure,
when you put it that way.

82
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,581
But it all worked out, right?

83
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,874
I suppose.

84
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,085
I do miss whistling though.

85
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,545
Oh, come on. Really?

86
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,589
First warning.

87
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,428
Penny.

88
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,305
Penny. Penny.

89
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,516
This is for you.

90
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,518
Hello, Sheldon.

91
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,645
Hi.

92
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,734
- What is this?
- It's a questionnaire I devised.

93
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,778
I'm having some difficulty bonding
with a colleague at work...

94
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:26,366
...so I'm doing a little research to better
understand why my current friends like me.

95
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,454
Yes, well, that is a good question.

96
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,165
But is this really the best way
to figure it out?

97
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,541
I agree.

98
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,501
The social sciences are largely hokum.

99
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,339
But short of putting electrodes in your brain
and monitoring your response...

100
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,592
...to my companionship,
this is the best I can do.

101
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,427
Okay, question one:

102
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,348
"Rank the following aspects
of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal:

103
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,267
Intelligence,
ruthless attention to hygiene...

104
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,937
...playfulness, Java-applet writing"?

105
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,233
I know. I may have started off
with a fairly obvious one.

106
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,652
An aspect
of my most appealing trait:

107
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,821
playfulness.

108
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,283
Why don't you rank that number one?
You're on your own for the rest.

109
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,452
It should take you
no more than three hours.

110
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,497
Well, wait, how many questions
are on this thing?

111
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,748
Only 211.

112
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,587
Don't worry. I've kept them all
at a high-school graduate reading level.

113
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,465
Thanks, pal.

114
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,801
You got it, buddy.

115
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,347
Sheldon, honey, did you ever consider
making friends by being...

116
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,641
...I don't know, pleasant?

117
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,894
Well, that's certainly
a thought-provoking hypothesis.

118
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,398
May I suggest it
as the topic for your essay?

119
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,323
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Your questionnaire, very disappointing.

120
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,036
I answered every question, Sheldon.

121
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,789
You answered the multiple choice
questions in a pattern.

122
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:01,002
A-B-B-A-C, A-B-B-A-C.

123
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,507
- Oh, you picked up on that, huh?
- Yeah, wait...

124
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,716
How could I not?

125
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,511
Well, uh, come on.
There's over 200 questions.

126
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,304
And look at some of these things.

127
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:16,393
"Sheldon is to camaraderie
as the space shuttle is to blank."

128
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,689
There are a number of acceptable answers.
For example, C, near-Earth transport.

129
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,984
But certainly not B, avocado rancher.

130
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,113
Your essay: I'd have better luck
making friends...

131
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,116
...if I wait till the Cylons take over?

132
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,702
Please.

133
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,745
Hold on. I put some real work into that.

134
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,206
Yes, well,
it's better than what Wolowitz did.

135
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:43,044
He drew a raccoon with what appears
to be a distended scrotum.

136
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,173
It's kind of cute.

137
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,135
- Uh, till you get to the scrotum.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,389
What hope do I have for establishing
new relationships, given that my friends...

139
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,434
...could not take a few hours
out of their lives to help me?

140
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,229
Well, Sheldon, I'm not going
to defend a big-balled raccoon.

141
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,939
Oh, I don't see how you could.

142
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,776
Ugh. What I'm trying to say
is that you can't approach this...

143
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,904
...as a purely intellectual exercise.

144
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,073
What do you mean?

145
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,204
Well, ah, remember when you tried to learn
how to swim using the Internet?

146
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,290
I did learn how to swim.

147
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,751
On the floor.

148
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,587
The skills are transferable.

149
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,423
I just have no interest
in going in the water.

150
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,966
Then why learn how to swim?

151
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,760
The ice caps are melting, Leonard.

152
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,763
In the future,
swimming isn't going to be optional.

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,434
But you do bring up an interesting point.
I don't have to break new ground here.

154
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,436
I'm sure the research already exists.

155
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,857
No. No, my point is
if you wanna learn how to make friends...

156
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,944
...then just go out to a coffee shop
or a museum.

157
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,113
Meet people. Talk to them.
Take an interest in their lives.

158
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,450
That's insane on the face of it.

159
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,036
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

160
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,455
You're driving me to the mall
to acquire a book...

161
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,167
...that summarizes the current theories
in the field of friend making.

162
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,713
Why don't you just lie down on the floor
and swim there?

163
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,221
"Coping With the Death of a Loved One."

164
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,641
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

165
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,601
Family or friend?

166
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,186
- Family.
- Too bad.

167
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,399
If it had been a friend,
I'm available to fill the void.

168
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,782
It's just as well.
She smelled like mothballs.

169
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,161
Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people,
I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.

170
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,622
Excuse me.

171
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,667
Do you have any books
about making friends?

172
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,044
Um, yeah, but they're all for kids.

173
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,089
Oh, I assume the skills
can be extrapolated and transferred.

174
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,593
Uh, I guess. They're right over there
by the wooden train set.

175
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,263
Oh! I love trains.

176
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,391
I bet you do.

177
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,147
Oh, my, that's awfully sticky.

178
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,067
All right.

179
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,194
Let's see.

180
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,159
"Bernie Bunny Has Two Daddies Now."

181
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,287
That's probably
about homosexual rabbits.

182
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,666
"Gerry the Gerbil
and the Bullies on the Bus."

183
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,210
Read it, not helpful.

184
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,672
Ooh. Well, here we go.

185
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,426
"Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo."

186
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,095
"Author Sarah Carpenter...

187
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,890
...lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana...

188
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,018
...with her husband
and best friend, Mark...

189
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,103
...and their cockatoo, Stu."

190
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,650
Hardly makes her an expert
in making friends, wouldn't you agree?

191
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,902
I don't like birds. They scare me.

192
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,821
Me too.

193
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,408
Most people don't see it.

194
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,703
What are you reading?

195
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,038
Curious George.

196
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,831
Oh, I do like monkeys.

197
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,416
Curious George is a monkey.

198
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,629
Somewhat anthropomorphized, but yes.

199
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,090
Say...

200
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,926
...maybe sometime you and I
could go see monkeys together.

201
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,095
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,263
Sheldon, what are you doing?

203
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm making friends with this little girl.

204
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,935
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

205
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,437
Hi, Rebecca.
I'm your new friend, Sheldon.

206
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,147
- No, you're not. Let's go.
- I...

207
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,400
We were really hitting it off.

208
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,610
Don't look up, there's cameras.

209
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,326
I'm curious, in the "How Well Do
You Know Sheldon?" section...

210
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,079
...what did you put
for his favorite amino acid?

211
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,498
Lysine.

212
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,500
Damn it, I had lysine and changed it.

213
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,211
Oh, good. You're just in time.

214
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,549
I believe I've isolated the algorithm
for making friends.

215
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,635
Sheldon, there is no algorithm
for making friends.

216
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,305
Hear him out. If he's onto something,
we could open a booth at Comic-Con...

217
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,141
...make a fortune.

218
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,853
You see, my initial approach to Kripke
had the same deficiencies...

219
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,815
...as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo
when he was new at the zoo.

220
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,651
Stu the Cockatoo?

221
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,987
Yes. He's new at the zoo.

222
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,991
It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence
into a simple flow chart...

223
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,826
...that will guide me through the process.

224
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,079
Have you thought about putting him
in a crate...

225
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,206
...while you're out of the apartment?

226
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,585
Hello, Kripke.
Yeah, Sheldon Cooper here.

227
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,504
It occurred to me you hadn't returned
any of my calls...

228
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,341
...because I hadn't offered any suggestions
for pursuing our friendship.

229
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:45,263
Yeah, perhaps the two of us
might share a meal together.

230
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,056
Yeah, I see.

231
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:51,186
Well, then perhaps you'd have time
for a hot beverage?

232
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,064
Popular choices include tea,
coffee, cocoa.

233
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,400
I see. No, no, no, wait.
Don't hang up yet.

234
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,361
But what about a recreational activity?

235
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,697
I bet we share some common interests.

236
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,700
Tell me an interest of yours.

237
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,162
Really? On actual horses?

238
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,541
Tell me another interest of yours.

239
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,879
Oh, I'm sorry. I have no desire to get
in the water till I absolutely have to.

240
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,256
Tell me another interest of yours.

241
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,051
- Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.
- I can fix it.

242
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,719
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

243
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,432
It's interesting but isn't ventriloquism
by definition a solo activity?

244
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,936
Yeah. Tell me another interest of yours.

245
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,395
Hmm.

246
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,315
Is there any chance you like monkeys?

247
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,067
Yeah, what is wrong with you?

248
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,611
Everybody likes monkeys.

249
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,279
Hang on, Kripke.

250
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:50,411
A loop counter and an escape
to the least objectionable activity.

251
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,247
Howard, that's brilliant.

252
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,749
I'm surprised you saw that.

253
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,254
Gee, why can't Sheldon make friends?

254
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,383
All right. That last interest strikes me
as the least objectionable.

255
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,095
And I would like to propose
that we do that together.

256
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,930
Tomorrow.

257
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,432
Yes, I'll pay.

258
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,434
All right, goodbye.

259
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,603
All right.

260
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,398
Time to learn rock climbing.

261
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,492
You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism.

262
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,288
Maybe you, me and your dummy
could go get a hot beverage.

263
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,957
He could talk while you drink.

264
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,960
Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.

265
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:49,596
This appears significantly more monolithic
than it did on my laptop.

266
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,642
You know, one expects to see hominids
learning to use bones as weapons.

267
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,978
- Hey, you afraid of heights, Cooper?
- Hardly.

268
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,480
A fear of heights is illogical.

269
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,026
Fear of falling, on the other hand,
is prudent and evolutionary.

270
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,737
What would you say
is the minimum altitude...

271
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,489
...I need to achieve to cement
our newfound friendship?

272
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:13,036
Come on, they have birthday parties here.
Little kids climb this.

273
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,998
Little kid hominids, perhaps.

274
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,670
So is this your entire job?

275
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,381
Your parents must be so proud.

276
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,592
Let's go, Cooper.

277
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,594
Coming, Kripke.

278
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,431
Okay, harness seems to be secure.

279
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,186
A small amount of incontinence just now,
but the website said that's to be expected.

280
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,356
Hey.

281
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,192
This isn't so bad.

282
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,111
It's a bit like vertical swimming.

283
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,365
Look at you.
You're almost halfway to the top.

284
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,866
I am? I...

285
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,703
I was wrong.

286
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,373
It is a fear of heights.

287
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,708
- You all right there, Cooper?
- Not really.

288
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,879
I feel like an inverse tangent function
that's approaching an asymptote.

289
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,298
- Stuck?
- What part of "inverse tangent function...

290
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,634
...approaching an asymptote"
did you not understand?

291
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,428
I understood all of it, I'm not a moron.

292
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,638
Just keep going.

293
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,890
Yeah, I don't think I can.

294
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,558
Well, then climb back down.

295
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,562
No, that doesn't seem any more likely.

296
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,231
So, what's the plan, Cooper?

297
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:28,403
Well, it's not exactly a plan
but I think I'm going to pass out.

298
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,415
I'm sorry,
can we just do it one more time?

299
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,708
Okay.

300
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,252
One, two. One, two, three and...

301
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,769
It's a little thing but you really do miss it.

302
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,479
Hello, everyone.

303
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,025
I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke,
home for dinner.

304
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,112
Hello to you too.

305
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,947
How was rock climbing?

306
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,490
He passed out.

307
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,993
Just hung there like a big salami.

308
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,371
Eh, eh, eh. That's where I sit.

309
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,624
Ooh, you have a special spot.
What kind of wacko are you?

310
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,836
How much time you got?

311
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,630
You want some Chinese food?

312
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,966
Terrific. Got any dental floss?

313
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,801
In the bathroom.

314
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,303
Be right back.

315
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,849
I gotta floss the lndian food out of my teeth
if I'm gonna eat Chinese.

316
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,643
Sheldon, are you okay?

317
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,022
Oh, yes. I pass out all the time.

318
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,984
But it was worth it. I've made substantial
progress in bonding with Kripke...

319
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,653
...which brings me
to an awkward moment.

320
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,656
- What's that?
- Maintaining five friendships...

321
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,160
...promises to be a Herculean task.

322
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,704
So I'm going to have
to let one of you go.

323
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,793
Me, me, let it be me.

324
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,173
Leonard, you are my roommate,
my source of transportation...

325
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:16,344
...and you help me fold my sheets
when they come out of the dryer.

326
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,346
You are safe.

327
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,849
- Can I whistle?
- Don't be silly.

328
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,643
Howard...

329
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,561
...you do not have a Ph.D.

330
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,023
Your cologne is an assault on the senses.

331
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,860
And you're not available for video games
during the Jewish High Holidays.

332
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,531
- Guilty as charged. I'm out.
- No.

333
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,241
You, too, are safe.

334
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,495
Come on. What do I have to do?

335
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,872
Okay, you know what?
I see where this is going.

336
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,249
I'm not one of you guys.

337
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,209
- I'm not a scientist, so...
Penny...

338
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,379
...everything you're saying is true,
but please allow me to continue.

339
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,714
Raj, you're out.

340
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,055
It's a good question.

341
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,599
While you do provide
a certain cultural diversity...

342
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:08,229
...to a homogenous group, your responses
to the questionnaire were truly disturbing.

343
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,567
How could you for a moment think
that my favorite amino acid is glutamine?

344
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,571
- He had lysine but changed it.
- Yeah.

345
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,073
Should have, would have,
could have, Raj.

346
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,661
I like to floss before I eat...

347
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,914
...so my gum pockets
are open for new food.

348
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,916
Ew.

349
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,670
Hello.

350
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,465
How did I walk past you?

351
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,758
I'm Barry.

352
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,761
- Penny.
- Eh, that's not a very hot name.

353
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,098
I'm gonna call you "Roxanne."

354
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,934
Ooh, pot stickers.

355
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,022
Suddenly, I'm looking pretty good, huh?

356
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,570
So, uh, Kripke,
I was wondering if there's any chance...

357
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,907
...you could get me some time
on the Open Science Grid computer?

358
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,533
No.

359
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,784
No?

360
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,286
But we're friends.

361
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:10,124
I'm sorry. No, my friend.

362
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,210
I'm confused.

363
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,130
I was given to understand that you allow
your friends time on the machine.

364
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,591
No, that's wrong.
There's an official schedule.

365
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,801
I have no control over it.

366
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:28,392
Oh. This entire endeavor seems
to have been an exercise in futility.

367
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,229
Raj, you're back in.

368
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,483
He likes monkeys.

369
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,117
You gotta give him credit
for sticking with it.

370
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,912
I didn't think he had it in him.

371
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,623
And he almost made it to the top
this time.
