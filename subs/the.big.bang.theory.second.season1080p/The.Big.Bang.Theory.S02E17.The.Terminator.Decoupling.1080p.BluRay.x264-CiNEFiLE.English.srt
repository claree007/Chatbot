1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,586
Okay, Raj...

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:07,214
...hand me the number six
Torx screwdriver.

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,092
Stop.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,886
We can't do this. It's not right.

5
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,680
Sheldon, you have got two choices.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,434
Put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo
or delete stuff before we go out of town.

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,478
But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:26,108
The warranty is a sacred covenant
we've entered into with the manufacturer.

9
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,943
He offers to stand by his equipment.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,655
We in return agree not to violate
the integrity of the internal hardware.

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:36,785
This little orange sticker is all that stands
between us and anarchy.

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,955
Okay,
then we won't touch the hard drive.

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,875
We'll just erase the first season
of Battlestar.

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,628
There. We're outlaws.

15
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,051
- Here you go, Leonard. Is this big enough?
- It's perfect.

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,515
For taking daffodils to your unicorn.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,101
It's just for my notebooks.
Thanks, Penny.

18
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,854
I love San Francisco.
I wish I was going with you.

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,230
I understand your envy.

20
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,441
This is a can't-miss symposium.

21
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,236
There are going to be discussions
on bioorganic cellular computer devices...

22
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,822
...advancements
in multi-threaded task completion...

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,659
...plus a round table on the non-equilibrium
Green's Function approach...

24
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,037
...to the photoionization process
in atoms.

25
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,792
When I go, I usually just get hammered
and ride the cable cars.

26
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,835
This conference is a big thing.

27
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,379
The keynote address
is delivered by George Smoot.

28
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,715
Oh, my God. The George Smoot?

29
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,718
- You've heard of him?
- Of course I haven't.

30
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,597
George Smoot
is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist...

31
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,641
...one of the great minds of our time.

32
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,351
His work in black body form...

33
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,521
...and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation...

34
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,982
...cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,859
It's kind of a funny name though.

36
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,028
Smoot.

37
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,491
It's like talking to a chimp.

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,246
Okay, now that I've been completely
insulted, have a good flight.

39
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,541
- Yeah, I wish.
- We're not flying. We're taking the train.

40
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,792
Oh, cool.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,672
Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying
and costs almost twice as much.

42
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,509
- Well then why are you doing it?
- Well, we had a vote.

43
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,095
Three voted for airplane,
Sheldon voted for train.

44
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,722
So we're taking the train.

45
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,936
Don't say it like that, Leonard.
Say it like, "We're taking the train!"

47
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,799
We're going to the Apple store
to make fun of the Genius Bar.

48
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,467
You wanna come?

49
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,180
Oh, I always enjoy that,
but I'm a little busy.

50
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,431
What are you doing?

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,892
I'm simplifying the task of packing
for our trip.

52
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,102
See, by attaching RFID tags
to my clothing...

53
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,231
...it will enable my laptop to read
and identify the items with this wand.

54
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,068
Then cross-reference them against
destination, anticipated activity spectrum...

55
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,113
...weather conditions,
duration of trip, etc.

56
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,619
Well, that does sound much simpler.

57
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,705
How long is this gonna take?

58
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,541
Assuming I can keep up this pace,
three hours 11 minutes.

59
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,587
Plus however long it takes to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.

60
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,631
Wow.

61
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,218
Teasing the guys at the Apple store
seems a little redundant now.

62
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,679
- I don't follow.
- I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.

68
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,332
Whatever it is,
I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,253
Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight...

70
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,174
...one of the great American trains operating
on one of the classic American routes.

71
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,177
On this side,
you'll see panoramic ocean vistas...

72
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,138
...inaccessible
to any other form of transportation.

73
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,600
While on your side
you'll be treated to 350 miles...

74
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,521
...of Costcos, Jiffy Lubes and cinder block
homes with above-ground pools.

75
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,276
- Come on, Raj.
- What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?

76
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,445
No.

77
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,699
- Why not?
- That's over the wheelbase.

78
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,035
Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics...

79
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,081
...of a pre-1980 Pullman-built
Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?

80
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,375
Sheldon,
we've been on this train 90 seconds...

81
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,794
...and you've already said
a thousand words.

82
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,797
Just tell us where to sit and shut up.

83
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,217
Here.

84
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,053
I'm hoping once you reap
the endorphic rewards...

85
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,390
...of the steady clickety-clack
of steel wheels on polished rails...

86
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,560
- ...your sour disposition will abate.
- Yeah, maybe.

87
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:17,065
Back in the 21st century, people are raising
tray tables and putting seat-backs upright...

88
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,235
...because it's time to land
in San Francisco.

89
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,739
It's not so bad really.
At least these trains have modern plumbing.

90
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,576
In India, you squat over a hole in the train
and expose your naked buttocks...

91
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,578
...to the chilly air of Rajasthan.

92
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,331
He is referring, of course, to third class...

93
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,167
...on Indian Railways' magnificent
Ranakpur Express...

94
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,880
...and its 1200-kilometer journey
from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.

95
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,841
Oh, look.
Now he's boring on an international scale.

96
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,262
Holy crap, look.

97
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,099
- Is that who I think it is?
- It can't be.

98
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,685
What would Summer Glau
be doing riding the train?

99
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:58,106
Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.

100
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,901
Unlikely.
That's a television show, Leonard.

101
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,111
Thank you.

102
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:08,283
If Skynet did exist in the future, a perfect
way to infiltrate and destroy mankind...

103
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,702
...would be to send Terminators back
as actors...

104
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,538
...who have played Terminators
in films and television...

105
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,041
...lulling us into a false sense
of security, i.e.:

106
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,627
"That's Summer Glau
from The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

107
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,171
No, Summer, don't kill me!
I'm pro-robot."

Sheldon, I owe you an apology.

113
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,979
Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance.
I've actually got a shot at a Terminator.

114
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,981
Please. When it comes to Terminators...

115
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,360
...you've got a better shot of scoring
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

116
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,154
You're overlooking something.

117
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,784
I have 11 hours with her
in a confined space.

118
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,662
Unless she's willing to jump off
a moving train...

119
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,457
...tuck and roll down the side of a hill,
she will eventually succumb...

120

...to the acquired taste
that is Howard Wolowitz.

121
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,800
My money's on tuck and roll.

122
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm confused.

123
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:13,640
I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.

124
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,477
- Let me explain to you how this works.
- All right.

125
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,147
- That's Summer Glau.
- Yes?

126
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,357
That's it.

127
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,443
Hang on a sec.

128
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,821
- Why do you get first crack at her?
- Uh, well, let's see. Couple reasons.

129
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,781
One, I saw her first.

130
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,032
No, you didn't. I did.

131
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,536
Fair enough. But then let me move on
to number two.

132
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,290
Unlike you, I can actually talk to women
when I'm sober.

133
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,544
You fail to take into account
that even mute, I am foreign and exotic...

134
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,548
...while you, on the other hand,
are frail and pasty.

135
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,551
Well, you know the old saying.

136
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,221
Pasty and frail, never fail.

137
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,726
Excuse me, but what about me?

138
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,144
Why don't I get a shot?

139
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,689
Fine, go ahead, take a shot.

140
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,027
I've already got a gorgeous blonde
back home I can't score with.

141
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,029
I think I'll let you two take this one.

142
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,865
Sheldon, is there a place on this train
to get alcohol?

143
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,241
Interesting that you ask.

144
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,745
The Coast Starlight recently added
the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car.

145
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,166
Built in 1956 and originally known as
the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level...

146
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,084
- Which way?
- Upper level is a bar...

147
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,338
...that offers wine tastings
if you're going as far as Portland.

148
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,049
Aren't you gonna go talk to her?

149
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,593
I will.
I'm just working on my opening line.

150
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,012
She's probably heard every possible line,
Howard.

151
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,597
Why don't you try, "Hello?"

152
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,016
No, no, no.
That always creeps girls out.

153
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:43,438
I need to come up with something that's
funny, smart and delicately suggests...

154
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,359
...that my sexual endowment
is disproportionate to my physical stature.

155
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,071
You're gonna need more than 11 hours.

156
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,948
Oh no.

157
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,909
- What's the matter?
- I forgot my flash drive.

158
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,203
- So?
- So we have to go back.

159
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,622
Okay, Sheldon, I'm gonna say, "Why?"

160
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,043
And your answer cannot be
"Because I forgot my flash drive."

161
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,294
You don't understand.

162
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,922
My flash drive has my paper
on astrophysical probes...

163
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,216
...of M-theory effects
in the early universe...

164
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,969
...I was gonna give to George Smoot
at the conference.

165
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,972
Why do you have to give your paper
to George Smoot?

166
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,975
It's brilliant. He needs to read it.

167
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,978
So you'll send him an email
when we get back.

168
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,231
Then I won't get to see
his face light up as he reads it.

169
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,234
- Right. Of course.
- Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.

170
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,112
Well, there's nothing you can do about it,
so relax.

171
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,658
Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack
of the steel wheels on the polished rails.

172
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,832

You forgot your flash drive
You forgot your flash drive

174
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,545
You forgot your flash drive

175
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,339
Only 10 hours, 55 minutes to go.

176
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,509
You forgot your flash drive
You forgot your flash drive

177
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,978
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

178
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,535
So, where you gals headed?

179
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,163
Okay, I've found the perfect solution.

180
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,540
We get off the train at the next stop
in Oxnard.

181
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,044
We then take the 1: 13 train
back to Union Station.

182
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,338
We take a cab back,
get my flash drive...

183
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:35,634
...and race to San Luis Obispo, assuming
the lights are with us, minimal traffic...

184
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,177
...we'll meet the train.

185
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,889
- I've got a better idea.
- Are you going to be sarcastic?

186
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,184
Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.

187
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,435
But, look, Penny's home.

188
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,397
Why don't we call her, have her get
your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?

189
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,067
But the flash drive
is in a locked drawer in my desk.

190
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,402
- So?
- The key is hidden in my room.

191
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,446
- So?
- Penny'd have to go into my room.

192
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,074
- So?
- People don't go in my room.

193
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,868
I see. Well, it seems once again...

194
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,372
...you're caught
between a rock and a crazy place.

195
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,792
Oh, I hate when that happens.

196
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,047
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.
It's hot in here. Must be summer.

197
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:19,052
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

198
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,014
- That's cute.
- Really? I just made it up.

199
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,310
Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?

200
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,187
Oh yeah, I loved it.

201
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,189
It's loosely based on my life.

202
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,029
We're putting the play on for one night
in this little 99-seat theater.

203
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,281
Can you come? Oh, great.

204
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,618
Do you know 98 other people
that might wanna come?

205
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,121
Oh, hang on. Hello?

206
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,790
Listen. I'm about to give you
a set of instructions...

207
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,834
...which you must follow to the letter.

208
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,252
Just a sec.

209
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,046
Theater's above a bowling alley
so it's a little noisy...

210
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,134
...but it might be the only chance
I'll ever get to play Anne Frank.

211
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,344
And the director is brilliant.

212
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,931
He uses the bowling sounds
as, like, Nazi artillery.

213
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,100
Okay, great, I'll see you then.

214
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,145
- Hello?
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Okay, step four.

215
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,857
Do you see that small plastic case
on my dresser?

216
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,817
Your dresser? Who is this?

217
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,485
It's Sheldon.

218
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,113
<font color="#808080">PENNY</font>: Oh, hey, Sheldon.
How's San Francisco?

219
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,576
I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a tra...
Were you even listening to me?

220
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,496
- No, I was talking to my friend. What's up?
- What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

221
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,956
I'm in a crisis situation...

222
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,710
...I need you to marshal your powers
of concentration, limited as they may be...

223
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,670
Give me the phone.

224
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,423
Hi, Penny, it's Leonard.

225
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,843
Hey, Leonard, what's going on
with Dr. Wackadoodle?

226
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,513
He's calling to ask you a favor.
You might be confused...

227
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,517
...because he didn't use the words "Penny,"
"Sheldon," "please" or "favor."

228
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,978
Okay. Enough chitchat.

229
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,774
Okay, step one: Locate your emergency key
to our apartment.

230
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,528
Step two: Enter our apartment.
Step three...

231
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,822
Enter my bedroom.

232
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,700
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Step four...
- Yeah, hang on, getting another call.

233
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,368
No!

234
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,830
Let me tell you something. Personal
robots cannot get here soon enough.

235
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,213
And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today...

236
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,381
...that's Venus.

237
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,925
That is so cool.

238
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,052
You know a lot about space.

239
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:30,391
Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly,
you were actually in space.

240
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,144
You're not one of those guys
who believe that?

241
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,065
You mean one of the hopeless geeks?
No.

242
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,691
Those are crazy people.

Howard, be a dear
and get me another one of these.

245
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,914
Now him, he's one of those geeks.

246
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,085
All right, now before you enter
my bedroom unescorted...

247
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,380
...I need you to understand
that this one time grant of access...

248
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,675
...does not create a permanent easement.

249
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,510
Easement.

250
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,181
It's a legal right of access. Good grief.

251
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,478
What? No, don't put me on hold. I...
Oh...

<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>:
Do you believe him?

253
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,194
Normally around women,
he has the personality of a boiled potato.

254
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,614
Put one beer in him,
and he's M. Knight Charmalarmalon.

255
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,662
Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

256
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,038
- What?
- Look at it.

257
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,125
Non-alcoholic beer.

258
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,545
- Then what's going on?
- I don't know.

259
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,298
Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.

260
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,925
Placebo, you say.

261
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,136
Interesting.

262
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,889
Yes, I'm still here.
Where am I going? I'm on a train.

263
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,601
Now, what you'll be looking for
is a small wooden box...

264
00:14:54,768 --> 00:15:00,023
...located between a Hoberman Sphere
and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.

265
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,816
Hoberman Sphere.

266
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,486
It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron.

267
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,825
No, the thing with the time on it
is my alarm clock. My God.

268
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,580
Actually, in India,
the names of constellations are different.

269
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:20,501
Where you have the Big Dipper,
we have the Big Curry Pot.

270
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,462
You're making that up.

271
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,714
You got me.

272
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,216
Now, what are you going to do with me?

273
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,431
- Raj. Look.
- Yes?

274
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,475
- What am I looking at?
- You tell me.

275
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,686
Non-alcoholic beer.

276
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,365
Hi. I'm the small package
good things come in.

277
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,871
Okay, I got a box, but there's no key
in here. Just letters.

278
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,665
That's the wrong box. Put it back.

279
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,584
Oh, Sheldon, are these letters
from your grandmother?

280
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,169
Don't read those letters.

281
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,464
Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie.
That is so cute.

282
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,633
<font color="#E86CE4">(SHRIEKING)</font>
Put down the letters!

283
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,179
Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.

284
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,973
Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?

285
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,601
Delightful. I don't know
what you're doing right now...

286
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,188
...but there are little bubbles forming
in the corner of Sheldon's mouth.

287
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,233
Okay. Yeah, I kind of crossed a line.
Put him back on.

288
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,651
Thank you.

289
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,738
- I'm back.
- What up, Moon Pie?

290
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,701
No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw.

291
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,663
Hey, Penny. Leonard again.

292
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,751
So anyway, in the dream, you and I
were ice skating, just the two of us.

293
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,129
And then I picked you up
by your ankles...

294
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:50,758
...and twirled you round and round
until your legs tore off.

295
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,347
I mean, I tried to stick them back on,
but before I could...

296
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:01,227
...you turned into a giant loaf
of pumpernickel bread.

297
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,854
What do you think that means?

298
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,524
I really don't know.

299
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,110
I'll give you a little clue.

300
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,697
My favorite sandwich?
Salami on pumpernickel.

301
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,741
Is that so?

302
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,537
Did you know the word pumpernickel comes
from the German words pumper and knickel.

303
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,040
Which loosely translates to fart goblin?

304
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,836
No. I didn't.

305
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,632
Okay, I found the box. Now what?

306
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,305
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box,
which takes 10 precise moves to open.

307
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:40,725
Okay, first locate the
panel with the diamond pattern...

308
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,604
...and slide the center portion
1 millimeter to the left.

309
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,856
Then, on the opposite end of the box...

310
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,151
...slide the entire panel
down 2 millimeters.

311
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,153
You'll hear a slight click.

312
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,990
Hang on. Sheldon, do you have
any emotional attachment to this box?

313
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,577
No. It's a novelty I ordered off the Internet.
Did you hear the click?

314
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,370
Not yet.

315
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,459
There it is.

316
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,339
Okay, here's another one.

317
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,551
If you married the famous rock guitarist
Johnny Winter...

318
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,012
...you'd be Summer Winter.

319
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,849
- Uh-huh.
- Yep.

320
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,021
Okay, I'm gonna just go for broke here
and say I like you.

321
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,773
Yeah?

322
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,733
So here's my question:

323
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:35,196
Do you see any conversational path that
would take us from where we are now...

324
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,116
...to a place where I could ask you out
and you'd say yes?

325
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,327
No.

326
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,498
Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.

327
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,291
Thank you.

328
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,754
But before I go...

329
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,218
...would you mind if I just take one picture
of us together for my Facebook page?

330
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,845
Sure.

331
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,564
Okay. Great.

332
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,191
Can I take one
where it looks like we're making out?

333
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:20,449
Okay, now you're going to insert
the flash drive into the USB port.

334
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,951

335
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,247
She calls me Moon Pie
because I'm nummy-nummy...

336
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,041
...and she could just eat me up.

337
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,797
Now please put the flash drive
in the USB port.

338
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,343
The one that looks like
a little duck's mouth.

339
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,724
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Terminator broke my phone.

340
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,607
Excuse me.

341
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,484
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

342
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,946
I've spent the last two hours imagining
various scenarios in my head...

343
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,616
...trying to come up with some line
to say to you...

344
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,077
...but then I finally realized
you're a human being, I'm a human being.

345
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,287
I could just say...

346
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,455
<font color="#808080">CONDUCTOR</font> <font color="#E86CE4">(ON PA)</font>:
Next stop, Santa Barbara.

347
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,707
I'm sorry. This is me.

348
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,295
"Hi, my name's Leonard."

349
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,928
So I'm thinking you won the Nobel Prize,
what, three years ago...

350
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,514
...so you must deal with a whole lot
of "What has Smoot done lately?"

351
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,645
My thought is we continue my research
as a team, you know...

352
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,480
...Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical...

353
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,817
...and when we win the Nobel Prize,
you'll be back on top.

354
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,112
With all due respect, Dr. Cooper,
are you on crack?

355
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,494
Fine. Smoot-Cooper.

356
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,330
Wow, what a diva.
