1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,839
Oh, boy.

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,091
What?

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:14,179
I can't comment without violating our
agreement that I not criticize your work.

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:19,351
- Then what was "Oh, boy"?
- Great restraint on my part.

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,937
There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

6
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:26,692
Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say "science."

7
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,783
Okay, how's that?

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,578
You actually had it right
in the first place.

9
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:43,042
Once again, you've fallen
for one of my classic pranks.

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,460
Buzzinga.

11
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,009
Well, now, here's a peculiar e-mail.

12
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:56,305
The president of the university wants me
to meet him at his office at 8 a.m.

13
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,516
- Why?
- Doesn't say. Must be an emergency.

14
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,352
Everyone at the university knows
I eat breakfast at 8...

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,813
...and move my bowels at 8:20.

16
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,026
Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,238
I guess you'll find out what it is
in the morning.

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,074
That's 14 hours away.

19
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,203
For the next 840 minutes, I'm effectively
one of Heisenberg's particles.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,498
I know where I am or how fast I'm going,
but I can't know both.

21
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,583
Yet how am I supposed to carry on...

22
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,669
...with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

23
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,505
Yeah, I know the feeling.

24
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,534
Leonard. Leonard.

25
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,743
Leonard.

26
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,621
Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,166
Why does everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

28
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,211
- Everybody?
- You, the president of the university...

29
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,547
...his wife,
their sullen teenage daughter.

30
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:17,594
That entire family is fascinated by what
time it is and whether people know it.

31
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,848
You went to President Seibert's house
in the middle of the night?

32
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,934
He didn't respond to my e-mail,
his phone number is unlisted.

33
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,520
Tell me what my other option was.

34
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,981
You could have waited until morning.

35
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,900
I know, look who I'm talking to.

36
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,822
Remember the grant proposal I submitted
to the National Science Foundation...

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,992
...to detect slow-moving monopoles
at the magnetic north pole?

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,745
Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

39
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,414
Oh, how nice.

40
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,958
Well, a space opened up
at the last minute...

41
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,503
...on the NSF expedition
to the Arctic Circle.

42
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,255
Wait a minute.

43
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,090
<font color="#E86CE4">(TOILET FLUSHES)</font>

44
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,302
He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

45
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,138
Yes.
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

46
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,100
He said, "Frankly,
if I could send you tonight, I would."

47
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,979
Okay. Well, do you wanna go?

48
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,899
Of course not.
I'm a theoretical physicist.

49
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,944
A career I chose in no small part
because it's indoors.

50
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,073
But if I'm able to detect slow-moving
magnetic monopoles there...

51
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,910
...I will be the scientist
who confirmed string theory.

52
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,995
And people will write books about me.

53
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:30,417
Third graders will create macaroni-art
dioramas depicting scenes from my life.

54
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,088
Sure. Maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

55
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,591
Sarcasm?

56
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,468
Maybe.

57
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,429
I am on the horns of a dilemma.

58
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,600
Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper,
at the North Pole?

59
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,727
Easy peasy. I'm doing it right now.

60
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,939
I'm not good with cold, Leonard.

61
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,441
How often have we had to leave
a movie theater...

62
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,986
...because I got a headache
from drinking the Icee too fast?

63
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,239
- I can't go.
- Then don't go.

64
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,826
How can you say that? The scientific
opportunity of a lifetime presents itself...

65
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,162
...my best friend says, "Don't go."

66
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,374
- All right, then go.
- Listen to you.

67
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,503
How can I possibly go?

68
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,421
What are the words I can say now...

69
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,258
...to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

70
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,721
Odd. President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

71
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,307
How was it resolved?

72
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,937
It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

73
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,024
Just imagine. If he says yes...

74
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,778
...we'll have an entire summer
without Sheldon.

75
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,115
We could play outside.

76
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,910
We could sit
on the left side of the couch.

77
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,788
I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

78
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,420
Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

79
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,967
Good news, gentlemen.
I have tentatively accepted...

80
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,052
<font color="#808080">ALL</font>:
Yeah!

81
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,018
...the invitation
to join the Arctic expedition.

82
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,604
- It's not gonna be the same without you.
- We're gonna miss you.

83
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,275
Thank you,
but your sentiments may be premature.

84
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,861
Oh, I don't like where this is going.

85
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,988
I would like to propose...

86
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,283
...that the three of you
accompany me.

87
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,078
- To the North Pole?
- Yes.

88
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,415
Is this just so we won't touch your stuff
while you're away?

89
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,377
I'll admit that was a concern.

90
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:42,215
But the fact is, I'll need a support team
and the three of you are my first choice.

91
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,010
- Really?
- Others might be more qualified...

92
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,305
...but the thought of interviewing them
gave me a stomachache.

93
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,516
I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking...

94
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,728
...so why don't you take a few moments
to discuss it?

95
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,608
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

96
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,235
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>:
I'm still within earshot.

97
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,655
You may wanna wait
for my door to close.

98
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,865
<font color="#E86CE4">(DOOR CLOSES)</font>

99
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,160
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

100
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:14,247
Hang on, let's talk about it. This is a
National Science Foundation expedition.

101
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,375
I don't know
how we can turn it down.

102
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,545
Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't
wanna go on an NSF expedition," say:

103
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,341
"No, we don't wanna spend three months
stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle...

104
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,593
...with an anal nutbag."

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,555
But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory...

106
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,059
...we could drink for free in any bar,
in any college town...

107
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,146
...with a university
that has a strong science program.

108
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,400
Howard, this is big science.
You could be the engineer...

109
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,778
...who builds the equipment
that puts us on the cover of magazines.

110
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:49,991
I could also be the engineer who builds
the crossbow that kills Sheldon.

111
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,123
You still might get on a magazine.

112
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,919
- You guys are seriously considering this?
- Yes.

113
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,090
- You think you can put up with Sheldon?
- Well, I'm a Hindu.

114
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:10,095
My religion teaches that if we suffer
in this life, we are rewarded in the next.

115
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,889
Three months at the North Pole
with Sheldon...

116
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,852
...and I'm reborn
as a well-hung billionaire with wings.

117
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,361
Well, gentlemen,
have you reached a decision?

118
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,198
- I'm in.
- Me too.

119
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,493
Damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

120
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,748
Excellent. And just an FYI,
as I am the expedition's team leader...

121
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,169
...protocol dictates that be phrased,
"Fine, sir."

122
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,464
But don't worry,
there will be a briefing.

123
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,302
Pssh!

124
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,723

Penny!

130
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,704
- What do you want?
- I need access...

131
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,123
...to the Cheesecake Factory's
walk-in freezer.

132
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,750
Honey, I already told you...

133
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,587
...the hamburger meat is fresh
and stored at a safe temperature.

134
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:31,218
No, this is to train for a three-month
expedition to the magnetic north pole.

135
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,969
What?

136
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:36,556
I don't know how that sentence
could possibly confuse you...

137
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,727
...but to elaborate,
I am going to the Arctic Circle...

138
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,979
...with Leonard, Wolowitz,
and Koothrappali.

139
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,940
- You're all going?
- Yes.

140
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,525
- For three months?
- Yes.

141
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,277
Excuse me.

142
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,031
Wait, is that a yes or a no
on the freezer?

143
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,660
That woman has the attention span
of a gnat.

144
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,580
Hey, Leonard. Sheldon says
you're going to the North Pole.

145
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,040
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

146
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,085
Yeah, I'm just a little surprised
you didn't tell me.

147
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,920
Well, it all happened kind of fast.

148
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,006
And we had to get physicals
and buy thermal underwear...

149
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,968
...and study up on, you know,
snow and stuff.

150
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,639
- Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
- No, you don't have to apologize.

151
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,059
There's no reason you have to tell me.
I was just surprised.

152
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,979
You were busy, you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

153
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,939
Now, where do we stand
on the freezer?

154
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,275
Is he serious?

155
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,151
Actually, it would help.

156
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,029
All right, I'll see what I can do.

157
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,283
So, wow, three months
at the North Pole.

158
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,911
- Wow, that is awesome.
- Yeah.

159
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:45,083
Sorry but at what point do you put this
"see what you can do" plan into action?

160
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:51,339
Just a warning, Sheldon.
The freezer locks from the outside.

161
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,140
- Did she seem upset to you?
- No. Did she seem upset to you?

162
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,684
- No.
- Oh, good, I got it right.

163
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,021
Are you upset?

164
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,356
A little bit.

165
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,109
Two for two. I'm on fire.

166
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:17,073
She's not my girlfriend but wouldn't
you think she'd feel a little bad...

167
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,743
...that I'm gonna be gone
for the whole summer?

168
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,162
That feels like a bonus question.

169
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,875
I'm gonna stop here while I'm ahead
but I've had a great time.

170
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:43,725
All right, and the purpose of this drill
is to acclimate us to the use of tools...

171
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,228
...in extreme temperatures
such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.

172
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,855
Then where are your tools?

173
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,191
Right here.

174
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,444
All right, team,
open up your practice kits.

175
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,406
As the university did not permit me
to bring the equipment we'll be using...

176
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:03,078
...to the Cheesecake Factory,
because apparently, I'm ridiculous...

177
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,873
...I've provided substitutes
which will exercise your fine motor skills.

178
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,919
Leonard, you will be doing a series
of complex mathematical problems...

179
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,048
...on a vintage Casio model 1175
calculator watch I received...

180
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,551
...when I won the Earth Science medal
in third grade.

181
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,888
Treat it with respect.

182
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,393
Raj, you will be painting sideburns
and a Vandyke...

183
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,562
...on a 6-inch figurine
of Legolas the Elf.

184
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,566
Now, remember, a Vandyke
is a goatee without a mustache.

185
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,988
Wolowitz, you will be completing a series
of delicate surgical procedures...

186
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,826
...on the classic children's game,
Operation.

187
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:51,960
To begin with,
you will remove funny bone for $200.

188
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,630
For this, I went to MIT.

189
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,298
And begin.

191
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,348
I think I swallowed some paint.

192
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,144
I can't press any of the buttons
with my gloves.

193
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,480
Oh, son of a bitch.

Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.

197
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,322
- Okay, I can't do this.
- Me either.

198
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,325
Gentlemen, use your imagination.
Innovate.

199
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:29,330
Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze
to death on the ice planet of Hoth?

200
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:34,836
No, he cut open a tauntaun and used
its internal body heat to warm him up.

201
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,964
You heard the man.
Hold him down and I'll cut him open.

202
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,051
Hang on. I know I don't possess the tools
of leadership, but I don't understand...

203
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,639
...why we can't assemble the equipment
inside the hut and then take it outside.

204
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,809
I hadn't thought of that.

205
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,189
I guess we're done here.

206
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,321
Here, drink-slash-eat this.

207
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,074
- What is it?
- It's hot chocolate with a stick of butter.

208
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,536
Okay, why?

209
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,830
In the frigid temperatures
in the Arctic...

210
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,542
...we need to consume 5000 calories
a day to maintain our body weight.

211
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,378
You know I can't eat butter.
I'm lactose intolerant.

212
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,090
Way ahead of you. That's an
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! stick.

213
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,511
But, Mommy, all the other guys
are going to the North Pole.

214
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,846
I don't care
what the other guys are doing.

215
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,265
If the other guys jumped
in the Bay of Bengal...

216
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,726
...and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,
would you?

217
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,063
If you were standing behind me nagging,
I might.

218
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,900
Don't talk back to your mother.
This trip is much too dangerous.

219
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,237
No, it's not. Howard, tell them.

220
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,199
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste.

221
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,952
I understand you're concerned.

222
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,205
If it'll make you feel better,
my mother is fine with me going.

223
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:56,960
And this is a woman who kept
a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.

224
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,880
So she has no problem
with her son being eaten by a walrus?

225
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,966
That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali.

226
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,636
If Raj dies, it'll be from frostbite,
gangrene, acute sunburn...

227
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,640
...or being ripped to shreds
by a 1500-pound polar bear.

228
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,102
Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone
with Raj's parents.

229
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,730
Can you tell them that you're okay
with me going to the Arctic?

231
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,239
I didn't say that.
You never listen to me.

232
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,949
He doesn't tell me anything.

233
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:32,287
He lives a secret life
because he's ashamed.

234
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,081
Hey, Leonard,
can I talk to you for a sec?

235
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,919
Sure, but let's go out here where
there's a little less yelling and guilt.

236
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,754
What's up?

237
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,257
Well, I got you
a little going-away present.

238
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,635
- Oh, a blanket.
- Oh, no, no. Not just a blanket.

239
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,680
See, it has sleeves.

240
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,309
Yeah.

241
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:01,024
So you can, you know, be all snoodled
up while you do your science stuff.

242
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,611
Oh, wow. Cool.

243
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,405
I'm gonna miss you.

244
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,123
- See you later.
- Bye.

- Sheldon?
- I want a cookie, Meemaw.

00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,367
- Sheldon, it's me.
- But Meemaw just made cookies.

on the expedition.

- What?
- I don't think I can go to the North Pole.

255
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,254
Okay. Leonard, I know you're concerned
about disappointing me...

256
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,091
...I want you to take comfort
from the knowledge...

257
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,719
...that my expectations of you
are very low.

258
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,722
Yeah, that's very comforting.

259
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,599
Comforting is a part of leadership.

260
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,852
It's not a part I care for
but such is my burden.

261
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,731
Terrific. It's just that
I don't think Penny wants me to go.

262
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,027
Assuming that's a valid reason not to go,
which it isn't...

263
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,239
...how do you know this?
Did she say it?

264
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,032
Not exactly.

265
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,411
But she said she was gonna miss me
and she gave me this.

266
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,208
- What is it?
- It's a blanket with sleeves.

267
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,253
Oh, that's clever.

268
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,048
Let me see if I understand this.

269
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:53,386
Her missing you,
is an emotional state you find desirable.

270
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,722
- Yes, obviously.
- All right.

271
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,726
Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving...

272
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,229
...logic dictates you must leave.

273
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,275
Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone
for three months.

274
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,611
What if she doesn't miss me that long
and she meets someone else?

275
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,657
She does have a short attention span.

276
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,660
- So I can't go.
- Leonard, you may be right.

277
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,455
It appears that Penny secretly
wants you in her life...

278
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,249
...in a very intimate
and carnal fashion.

279
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,128
- You really think so?
- Of course not.

280
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,090
Even in my sleep-deprived state...

281

another one of my classic pranks.

- Seven a.m. I'm sorry it's early.

284
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,693

Okay.

286
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,948
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

287
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:02,330
I don't know.
You'll be gone and I'll notice.

288
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:08,086
Okay. Well, what about this?
What does this mean?

289
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:13,591
Wine, a credit card and late-night
television are a bad combination?

290
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,135
All right, fine.

291
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,514
What about that really long hug?
What did that mean?

292
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,016
That wasn't a long hug.

293
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,145
It was at least five Mississippis.

294
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,651
A standard hug
is two Mississippis, tops.

295
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,114
Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.
It was just a hug.

- Yeah.
