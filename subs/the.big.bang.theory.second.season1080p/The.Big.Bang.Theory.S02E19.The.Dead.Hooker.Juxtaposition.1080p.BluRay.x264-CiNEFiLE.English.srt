00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,627
Okay, it's done.

Look, guys, for the future,
I don't mind killing the big spiders...

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,551
...but you have to at least try
with the little ones.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,888
Penny, please. We're facing a far more
serious problem than stray arachnids.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,934
- Sheldon, it's not that bad.
- Not bad? It's horrible.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,855
You hear stories about this sort of thing.
You never think it will happen to you.

7
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,775
So they steamed your dumplings.
Get over it.

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,820
New topic, please.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,240
All right, Penny.
Let me take this opportunity to point out...

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,411
...that you are looking particularly
ravishing today.

11
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,415
Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.

12
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,961
So there is a number.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,006
Okay. New topic, please.

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,550
Hey, did you hear the people
in 5-A are moving out?

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,136
- No. Shh-shh-shh!
- Why?

16
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,056
- The people upstairs are moving out.
- No.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,225
The horror.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,811
Why would you just say something
like that?

19
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,273
- How else...?
- No, no, no.

20
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,484
How else was I supposed to say it?

21
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:13,155
Slowly. Like putting a new fish in a tank.
You don't just drop it in.

22
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,367
You let the bag sit in the water
a while.

23
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,661
The horror.

24
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:23,373
- Sheldon, I'm sure it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not going to be fine.

25
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,336
Change is never fine.
They say it is, but it's not.

26
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,380
Okay, did you even know the people
that are moving out?

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,840
I never met them.

28
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,343
That's what made them perfect.

29
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,512
There were no awkward hellos
in the halls.

30
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,932
There's no clickety-clacking
of high-heel shoes on hardwood floors.

31
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:44,937
They may as well have been a family of cats
just jumping around from drape to drape.

32
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,607
And without that annoying
ammonia-urine smell.

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,236
I'm sure the new people
will be just as quiet.

34
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,239
You can't know that.
How can you possibly know that?

35
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,909
You're right, I can't. You know what?
Anyone could rent that apartment now.

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,995
An opera singer, the cast of Stomp.

37
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,209
Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate
with a wooden leg.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,212
Why are you making it worse?

39
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,382

- Mm-hm.

to visit the former tenants.

as typical is demonstrably fallacious.

- Yeah.
- Alicia is an actress just like you.

That is so awesome.

- Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.
- I know, tell me about it.

I've been here three months.
All I've gotten is a couple commercials.

179
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,230
And this recurring thing on a soap.

180
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:56,404
That's why I work at The Cheesecake
Factory. I'm holding out for the right part.

I read the best science joke on the Internet.

Alicia, you won't get it,
but it's right up their alley.

188
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,270
Anyway, so this physicist goes
into an ice cream parlor every week...

189
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,439
...orders an ice cream sundae
for himself...

190
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,942
...and offers one to the empty stool
next to him.

191
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,945
This goes on until the owner
asks him what he's doing.

192
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,489
The man says, "Well, I'm a physicist...

193
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,118
...and quantum mechanics teaches us...

194
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,788
...that it is possible
for the matter above this stool...

195
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,290
...to spontaneously turn
into a beautiful woman...

196
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,835
...who might accept my offer
and fall in love."

197
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,754
The owner then says,
"Lots of women come in here every day.

198
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,258
Why don't you buy an ice cream for them,
and they might fall in love?"

199
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,676
And the physicist says:

200
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,971
"Yeah, but what are
the odds of that happening?" Ha.

201
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,478
That's a little insulting, don't you think?
