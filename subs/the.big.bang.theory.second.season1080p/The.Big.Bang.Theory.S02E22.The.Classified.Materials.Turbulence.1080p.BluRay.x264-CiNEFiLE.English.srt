That's the smell of new comic books.

00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,890
Oh, yes.

No, I'm celebrating.

at the Internationale Space Station...

...where it will deploy the Wolowitz
Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.

10
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,120
Oh, get over yourself.
It's a high-tech toilet.

11
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,415
Just think, thanks to your hard work...

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:46,879
...an international crew of astronauts will
boldly go where no man has gone before.

13

- Is that supposed to be funny?
- I believe it is.

of "to go"...

...suggest that Leonard is humorously
mocking your efforts in space plumbing.

Okay, make your little jokes.
But of the four of us...

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,190
...I'm the only one making any real-world
contribution to science and technology.

19
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,151
He's right. This is an important
achievement for two reasons:

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,528

It's mind-blowing.

27
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,257
Excuse me, spoiler alert.

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,593
But I didn't spoil anything.

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,388
You told me it's mind-blowing,
so my mind is going into it pre-blown.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,059
And once a mind is pre-blown,
it cannot be re-blown.

31
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,771
- I'm sorry.
- Said the Grinch to Christmas.

32
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,069
- Hey, can I talk to you about something?
- Sure. What's up?

33
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,780
Remember I went out with Penny
a couple weeks ago?

34
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,616
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure, you remember. That was the night...

35
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,912
...you went to the bar and made a fool of
yourself trying to pick up strange women.

36
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,250
What about it?

37
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,920
Well, the thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

38
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,173
Oh. Too bad. You know...

39
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,051
I guess the thing to do now is,
you know, pick yourself up.

40
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,053
Dust yourself off, forget it. Move on.

41
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,056
- I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

42
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,851
Because we're going out again tomorrow.

43
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,227
Excuse me, Stuart?

44
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,979
- Have you read the new Flash?
- No.

45
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,649
Well, I have,
and it will knock your socks off.

46
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,193
Good luck getting them back on.

47
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,825
Anyway, I figure this is probably
my last shot with Penny...

48
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,953
- ...and I don't wanna screw it up.
- Oh, nobody wants that.

49
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,246
So here's my question:

50
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:50,085
It's the second date. You think
she'll be expecting things to get physical?

51
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,298
Oh, gee.

52
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,718
Yeah, my initial reaction is no.

53
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,096
But, you know, let me think about it
and get back to you, okay?

54
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,890
Okay. So you'll give me a call?

55
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,142
- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.

56
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,978
Or nobody calls anyone.

57
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:13,734
Interesting, Penny's current suitor
asking advice from her former suitor.

58
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,112
Yeah, thanks for closed-captioning
my pain, Raj.

59
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,781
You wanna make sure he gets nowhere
with Penny...

60
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,035
...without jeopardizing your friendship
with either of them?

61
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,912
- I'm listening.
- Just tell him...

62
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,248
...to do everything you've done with her
for the last two years.

63
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,864
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi.

64
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,449
- How's it going?
- Good, good.

65
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,493
- You?
- Fine.

66
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,579
- Oh, yeah, hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

67
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,331
You know your friend Stuart?

68
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,708
Yes.

69
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,211
Well, he asked me out again
and I said yes.

70
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,339
And then I started thinking
maybe I should talk to you first.

71
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,800
- About what?
- Well, does it bother you?

72
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,718
Me going out with one of your friends?

73
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:26,306
- Because, you know, you and me...
- No. No, that's the past.

74
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,433
I'm really more of a right now
kind of guy.

75
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,852
You know, living in the moment.

76
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,065
Although I do have to live a little
in the future because, well, that's my job.

77
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,569
Of course, my fondness for classic science
fiction does draw my attention backwards...

78
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,572
...but those stories often take place
in the future, so...

79
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,035
In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.

80
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,039

do you mind giving me some advice?

86
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,430
He's very shy. How do I make him
feel more comfortable around me?

87
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:10,892
Well, first of all, don't underestimate
the value of discomfort.

88
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,187
- Really?
- Well, yeah. Stuart thrives under pressure.

89
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,107

Or the cherry-flavored soft drink
from the makers of Mountain Dew?

118
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,037
I was going over the schematics
on my Zero-G Toilet...

119
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,166
...and I made a teeny-tiny mistake
on the specifications for the diverter valve.

120
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,501
How teeny-tiny?

121
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,545
It's gonna fail after about 10 flushes.

- But the mission is for six months.
- That's the code red.

Be a little shy.

167
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,864
And don't make too much eye contact.

168
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,450
And you know, treat her with, like,
cool detachment.

169
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,996
And, you know, fear.

170
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,497
- Fear?
<font color="#808080">LEONARD</font>: Yeah.

171
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:47,711
Like you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

172
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,047
Well,
that plays right into my wheelhouse.

173
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,509
Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.

174
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,177
Thanks, Leonard.

175
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,929
What is that thing anyway?

176
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,515
You don't know what this is?

177
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,642
- No.
- Good, get out.

178
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,858
Be afraid of Penny. Nice, very crafty.

179
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,779
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.

180
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,200
For what it's worth, my mother says
that when we deceive for personal gain...

181
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,620
...we make Jesus cry.

182
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:35,300
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
to reinforce the center cross-support?

183
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,845
No good. I mean, it might work
for the Japanese and the Americans...

184
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,057
...but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

185
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:49,606
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

186
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,858
I feel terrible.

187
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,278
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

188
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,199
I deliberately tried to sabotage
Stuart's date with Penny.

189
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,827
Of course you feel terrible. You completely
screwed up your karma, dude.

190
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,455
You don't really believe in that superstition,
do you?

191
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,458
It's not superstition,
it's practically Newtonian.

192
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,461
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

193
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,465
Leonard pretends to be a friend,
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

194
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,512
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.

195
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,810
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

196
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,938
Speaking of what goes around
comes around...

197
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,690
Okay, look.

198
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,609
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here...

199
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,237
...what if we ran another line,
bypassed it entirely?

200
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,989
Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

201
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,158
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

202
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,952
It won't work. No way to mount it.

203
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,204
Here's an idea.
What if I change my name...

204
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,249
...and go live with my cousin
and her husband, Avi, in Israel?

205
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,961
That could work.

206
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,635
- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?

207
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:05,807
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a Zero-Gravity pasta maker.

208
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,020
- I'm gonna make a coffee run. Want any?
- No. I have coffee.

209
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,565
Great,
so how'd it go with Stuart last night?

210
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,277
I really don't wanna talk about it.

211
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,987
Yeah. Right. Sure.

212
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,740
But, you know, the thing is,
before you guys went out...

213
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,701
- ...I spoke to him and I...
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.

214
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,953
- Okay, I kind of feel res...
- Look, Leonard.

215
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,415
What goes on is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?

216
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:39,716
If you really want to clean up your karma,
go get my freaking latte.

217
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,851
Hang on, I think I've got this.

218
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,229
Help me see if we can wedge
this piece of PVC behind the support rod.

219
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,066
You're overestimating the strength
of the substructure you're building.

220
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,361
- Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
- If you knew what you were doing...

221
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,698
...there wouldn't be a space toilet
where my coffee table should be.

222
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,659
Howard, wait.

223
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:10,830
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC
to keep the filter assembly in place?

224
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,833
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

225
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:18,296
This is the thing from the pizza box
that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.

226
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,300
Is that what that's for?
In India, the lid just touches the cheese.

227
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,512
We also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera...

228
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,223
...so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

229
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,227
- Where you going?
- Comic-book store.

230
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,938
Oh, an excellent idea.
I could certainly use a break.

231
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,273
- Me too.
- You can go to the comic book store...

232
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,734
...when man can once again
safely poop in space.

233
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,070
Why does Leonard get to go?

234
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,489
Because he's upset
over his situation with Penny.

235
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,409
And if I have to hear about it again,
I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries.

236
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,955
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
<font color="#808080">HOWARD</font>: I got your back, sister.

237
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,502
All right, I think we've got a prototype
ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.

238
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,672
- That's heavy.
- Damn right, it's heavy.

239
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,131
It's my mother's meatloaf.

240
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,594
It's been testing toilets for generations.

241
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,388
I must say, Howard...

242
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,058
...I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances...

243
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,395
...might entitle you to a refund
on your Master's degree.

244
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:21,484
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste
disposal test with meatloaf analog.

245
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,697
In three, two, one.

246
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,289
Fascinating.

247
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,375
What do you think the problem is?

248
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,253
Not enough bread crumbs.

249
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,721
- Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?

250
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,182
I think I gave you some bad advice
about Penny and I want to apologize.

251
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,601
No, your advice was great.

252
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,186
- It was?
- Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.

253
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,314
You're kidding.

254
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,858
Never worked for me.

255
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,360
Yeah, last night at dinner
I did what you told me.

256
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,322
I went really slow, I kept my distance...

257
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,490
...and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out.

258
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,037
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

259
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,998
It doesn't matter.
That's where it all went to hell.

260
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,416
During the kissing?

261
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,503
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

262
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,674
No, everything was good and really hot.

263
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,802
And I said, "Oh, Penny"...

264
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,431
...and right where she was supposed
to say, "Oh, Stuart" she said...

265
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,434
...your name.

266
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,982
- Leonard?
- That is your name, right?

267
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,526
Yeah. No, yeah, it is.

268
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,278
Wow, I'm sorry.

269
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,864
That must've been the last thing
you wanted to hear.

270
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:54,369
Well, it beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

271
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,414
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

272
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,042
No doubt, no doubt.

273
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,129
Okay, well...

274
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,216
- ...I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Not your fault.

275
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,343
Yeah, how about that?

276
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,765
- See you soon.
- Yep, sure.

277
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,157
Yes, I understand. Classified.
We'll keep it all classified.

278
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,785
No one has to know anything about this
but you and me.

279
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,078
What's classified?

280
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,331
Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.

281
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:46,212
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.

282
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,172
I don't see why I have to worry.

283
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,634
My career's not hanging in the balance.

284
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,267
That was a joke.

285
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,187
It's funny because it's true.

286
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,277
Leonard,
could you pass the soy sauce, please?

287
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,613
- I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
- Yeah, I said Leonard.

288
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,783
Yes, you did, didn't you?

289
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,083
What the hell is that?

290
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,377
Meatloaf.

291
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,213
What was it doing on the ceiling?

292
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,966
That's classified.

294
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,977
We have a little situation up here.

295
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,022
We'd like to make an unscheduled
space walk.
