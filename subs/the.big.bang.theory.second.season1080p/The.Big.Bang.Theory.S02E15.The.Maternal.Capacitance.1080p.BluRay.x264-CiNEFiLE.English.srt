Fellas, please.

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,367
Penny, come on.
We were just finding our sound.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,372
You found it. It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,751
Well, I'm really very busy.

15
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:47,212
Is there any way we can put this off
until I have more time to prepare?

16
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,050
Of course,
but, uh, you understand my trepidation.

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,801
- What's that about?
- Not a clue.

18
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,429
Can't we just postpone it till the spring?

19
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,139
Maybe next summer?

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,058
This should be fairly easy to deduce.

21
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,478
He's holding the phone to his left ear.
Ears do not cross hemispheres.

22
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,856
He's using the analytical,
rather than emotional side of the brain...

23
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,318
...suggesting that he has
no personal relationship with the caller.

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,654
No, I didn't realize it had been so long.

25
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,908
Sure. I guess there's no other choice
but to go ahead and do it.

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,327
He's referring to an activity
he has done before.

27
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,579
It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated.

28
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:26,168
This suggests some sort of invasive
medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.

29
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,004
Aren't there any other options?
There's not a lot of room.

30
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,590
- It's gonna be uncomfortable.
<font color="#808080">SHELDON</font>: Yes, yes.

31
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,718
I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.

32
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,637
Okay, bye.

33
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,184
My mother's coming to visit.

34
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,855
How about that? You were right.

35
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,680
It's out of order.

36
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:24,184
Yes, I can read the sign.
I'm just pondering the implications.

37
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,189
I think it implies
that the elevator doesn't work.

38
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,192
Again, I can read the sign.

39
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,071
But the sign and tape are covered
with a layer of dust which indicates...

40
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,449
...the elevator has been nonfunctional
for an amount of time...

41
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,744
...which suggests either a remarkable
passivity among the...

42
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,081
...I assume 24 to 36 residents
of this building...

43
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,169
...based on the number of mailboxes and
given typical urban population density...

44
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,714
...or a shared delusion of functionality.

45
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,551
You must be Leonard's mother.

46
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,972
Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,100
- Uh, I'm Penny, I'm his neighbor.
- Oh, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

48
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,768
Oh, nice to meet you.

49
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,147
Oh, you're a hand shaker. Interesting.

50
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,109
Uh, come with me,
I'll walk you to the apartment.

51
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,238
Oh, all right. Would you like
to exchange pleasantries on the way?

52
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,074
- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- All right, you start.

53
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,704
I've always been curious.
What was Leonard like when he was little?

54
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,249
<font color="#808080">BEVERLY</font>: Oh, I think you mean young.
He's always been little.

55
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,752
Right.
What was he like when he was young?

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,712
You'll have to be more specific.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,132
Oh, um, okay, like five or six.

58
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,098
- Five.
- Oh, well, at that age...

59
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:49,311
...he was in what Freud would call the
phallic stage of psychosexual development.

60
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,896
An outmoded theory, of course.

61
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,567
But the boy did spend most of his waking
hours with a tight grasp on his penis.

62
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,570
Oh, yeah, Leonard mentioned
you were a psychiatrist.

63
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,491
Well, that is one of my degrees.
My primary field is neuroscience.

64
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,743
Oh. Well, I'm an actress.

Ha. What do you mean, why?

68
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,673
There were studies that suggest
many who go into the performing arts...

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,634
...suffer from an external locus
of identity.

70
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,266
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

71
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,019
Well, it means you value yourself
only as others value you...

72
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,065
...which is often the result
of unmet childhood emotional needs.

73
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,652
Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.

74
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,696
Tell me about it.

75
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,409

And then, I'm assuming,
you entered adolescence.

79
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,215
Uh-huh. He called me slugger
until I got my first training bra...

80
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,177
...and then he just stopped
playing catch with me.

81
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,681
I wasn't slugger anymore.

- Oolong?
- Yes.

87

- Loose, not bagged?
- Yes.

88
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,043
- Steeped three minutes? Two-percent milk?
- Yes. Yes.

89
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,461
- Warmed separately?
- Yes.

90
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,713
- One teaspoon sugar? Raw sugar?
- Yes. Yes.

91
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,633
It's cold.

92
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,097
I'll start again.

93
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,768
I have the same problem with him.

94
00:05:55,146 --> 00:06:00,442
My theory is that his lack of focus
stems from an over-developed sex drive.

95
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,070
Oh, I don't know where he got that.

96
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,781
Aside from a pro-forma consummation
of our marriage...

97
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,077
...his father and I only had intercourse
for the purposes of reproduction.

98
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,164
That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.

99
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, we think so.
We've both done papers on it.

100
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,588
Mine from a neuroscientific point of view
and his from an anthropological.

101
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,925
Mine, of course,
was the only one worth reading.

102
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,134
Of course.

103
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,763

to read about your sex life.

- ...what's new?
- You'll have to be more specific.

114
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,963
All right. Uh, what's new with you?

115
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,676
Oh, well, I've been having some fascinating
menopausal symptoms recently.

116
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,178
Maybe something less personal?

117
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,222
Oh.

118
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,515
Your Uncle Floyd died.

119

Oh, my God. What happened?

120
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,395
His heart stopped beating.

121
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,814
I have to urinate.

122
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,364
What a remarkable woman.

123
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,827
Yeah, I... I thought
you guys might hit it off.

124
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,912
I envy you your childhood.

125
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,289
I hate to tell you...

126
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:42,335
...but the only warm memories I have
of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.

127
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:46,673
You're clearly misremembering. Your mother
is brilliant, analytical, insightful.

128
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:51,011
I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible
because you wouldn't eat Brussels sprouts.

129
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,347
Sheldon, you don't give
your mother enough credit.

130
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,059
She's warm, she's loving,
she doesn't glue electrodes to your head...

131
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,438
...to measure your brain waves
while potty training.

132
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,190
You were lucky.

133
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:07,736
When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,
I had to attach my own electrodes.

134
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,532
So, Dr. Hofstadter...

135
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,870
...Leonard rarely talks about his
incredibly successful brother and sister.

136
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,081
- Please don't go there, Howard.
- You know, I understand...

137
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:25,462
...that unlike Leonard,
they're at the top of their respective fields.

138
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,173
Boy, you suck.

139
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,385
Leonard's younger brother, Michael,
is a tenured law professor at Harvard...

140
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:37,265
...and his sister just successfully grew
a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.

141
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,144
So she's close to curing diabetes?

142
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,439
Why else would you grow
a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

143
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,400
Wow, you must be very proud.

144
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,903
Why? They're not my accomplishments.

Oh, the middle stall was occupied.
I'll have to try again later.

In bladder voiding, as in real estate...

speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.

Oh, that's fascinating.
Selective mutism is quite rare.

164
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,184
On the other hand, an adult Jewish male
living with his mother is so common...

165
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,187

00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,613
Gotcha.

330
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,990
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye, Leonard.

331
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,619
So, slugger, shall we pick up
where we left off last time?

333
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:12,043
I mean, my mom could've just said,
"Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on."

334
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,337
But she didn't. Not one word.

335
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,423
Interesting. Would you be willing
to fly to New Jersey...

336
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,636
...and discuss your relationship
with your parents during a brain scan?

337
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,973
- Would it help?
- Well, it would help me.
